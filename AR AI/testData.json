            "Content" : "This Feasibility Study is only for students taking the Leaving Certificate examination. Feasibility Study places will only be offered in Round One of the CAO Admissions Process.\r\n\r\nFor the ninth year, Trinity is pioneering a feasibility study in admission to see if there is a better and fairer mechanism to identify and admit applicants who are enthusiastic and passionate about learning, motivated and suitable for their chosen courses, and with the academic ability and potential to be inspired by everything that college has to offer. The admissions scheme tested in this study will adopt a holistic approach that has worked successfully internationally, using a range of materials to make an assessment about the academic ability and potential of each applicant.\r\n\r\nThe new admissions route will be used to admit students on three courses - with ten places in History (TR003), ten places in Law (TR004), and five places in Ancient and Medieval History and Culture (TR028) filled using the new admissions route. Applicants to any of the three courses involved in the study will have the option of using the new admissions route, and submitting some supplementary materials (in which case they will be eligible for all of the regular places on the course filled in the traditional way, as well as the places set aside for the study), or opting out of the study, in which case they will remain eligible for all of the places allocated in the traditional way. Students applying for two or more of the courses in the study will only have to submit the supplementary information once.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility study is being operated in partnership with the Central Applications Office (CAO) and all applications will be made completely anonymous before evaluation, to ensure the process is free from any external influences. The three modalities which will be used to assess applicants in the study are as follows:\r\n\r\n(a) Leaving Certificate results.\r\n\r\n(b) Relative Performance Rank (RPR) – the performance of the applicant relative to other applicants from their school. This scale looks at the rank of the applicant compared to every other applicant from their school who has applied to any course, in any college, through the CAO.\r\n\r\n(c) Personal and Contextual Data – provided via supplementary materials submitted by the applicant.\r\n\r\nApplicants provide Personal and Contextual Data via a Personal Statement online. Personal statements are then reviewed by expert reviewers and used as a qualifier. Qualifying personal statements will be those which the reviewers score a 1, 2, 3, or 4 on a scale of 1 to 6. Applicants whose personal statements qualify according to the above will proceed to the next stage. In the scoring process, Leaving Certificate results and the Relative Performance Rank will be weighted equally and then the candidates will be ranked in order of their combined score for modalities (a) and (b).\r\n\r\nNames of applicants, any identifying information, and the names of schools attended, will be made completely anonymous before being evaluated by the review panels. Applicants will be required to provide supplementary information requested in a Trinity Application Form. Applications must be submitted online through the CAO before 1 February. Additional documentation can be accepted until 1 March. Applicants are asked to submit an honest piece of self-reflection, discussing what they would like to study, and why, and this is what will be evaluated. Grammar, vocabulary, and writing style will not be scored.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility study is an attempt to inform broader educational change by providing options to assist in the development of national policy and to see whether, on a small scale and in a strictly controlled way, it might be possible to admit students using a range of assessments (including the Leaving Certificate), with the results published and shared throughout the sector. It recognises the importance of having a Leaving Certificate examination that is fit-for-purpose and supports the reforms that are currently underway at second level to ensure a more positive educational experience. It also recognises and values the great work and commitment of the teachers at primary and second-level throughout Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe admissions route tested here seeks to complement the role of the Leaving Certificate and the teaching community, by working with the Central Applications Office (CAO) to examine whether some approaches which have succeeded internationally might also work in an Irish context.\r\n\r\nAdmissions through the Trinity Feasibility Study \r\nCandidates who have been successful in gaining a place through the feasibility study will be notified of their offer by CAO as normal and should follow the CAO's offer procedures to accept their place on the course.\r\nSuccessful applicants will also receive an email from Trinity College Dublin confirming that the CAO offer has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants admitted through the Trinity Admissions Feasibility Study who are also eligible HEAR and\/or DARE candidates will retain their right to the supports offered by those access routes.\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants should note that in order to qualify for admission to a course through the TAFS study, they must meet the University's minimum entry requirements. The minimum entry requirements can be found at https:\/\/www.tcd.ie\/study\/apply\/admission-requirements\/undergraduate\/index.php\r\n\r\nNOTE: Feasibility Study places will only be offered in Round One of the CAO Admissions Process.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRechecks\r\nGrounds for Requesting a Recheck\r\nTo request a recheck, applicants must complete an online recheck form by 5.15pm on 21st August (to be confirmed). The only ground for requesting a recheck is:\r\n\r\nIf the applicant believes there was an administrative error in the screening of his\/ her application.  This might include the incorrect total being entered for a modality or an incorrect calculation of their combined scores.\r\nThe Purpose of a Recheck\r\nA recheck is a review of the application to make sure there were no administrative errors in the screening of that application.  \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:  The purpose of a recheck is not to rescreen the application for eligibility, but rather to ensure that there was no administrative error in the original assessment.  The recheck screening sheet pulls up all the information from the original assessment, and the documentation is then reviewed to determine if there was an administrative error.\r\n\r\nHow to Request a Recheck\r\nTo request a recheck please complete the recheck form located here\r\n\r\nYou will be notified of the results of the recheck in early September.\r\n\r\nQueries\r\n\r\nApplicants who applied through the Trinity Admissions Feasibility Study and have queries can contact academic.registry@tcd.ie",
