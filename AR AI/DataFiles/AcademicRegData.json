The information can be found under the heading 'How Do I Claim a Refund'.student finance webpage, https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/fees-and-payments/applicants/how_do_i_pay/index.php, Important: The TCD tuition/fee refund policy is separate from the Federal Regulations laid out below to repay unearned aid., Note: The return of Federal Loan Funds takes precedence over the college’s own tuition refund policy in the event of withdrawal. However, students should note that the return of loan funds does not cancel their liability to Trinity College Dublin for any tuition fee balance outstanding on their account. , , Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4), Timing of Calculation: Regulations require Trinity to perform calculations within 30 days from the date we determine a student has withdrawn. We must return the funds within 45 days of the calculation and the calculation must be performed within 30 days of the date of determination of withdrawal. Once the R2T4 calculation has been undertaken, TCD will issue a copy to the student by email., Calculation Method: The following formula is used to determine the percentage of unearned aid that has to be returned to the federal government:, The percent earned is equal to the number of calendar days completed up to the withdrawal date, divided by the total calendar days in the payment period (less any scheduled breaks that are at least 5 days long). , The percent earned is equal to the number of calendar days completed up to the withdrawal date, divided by the total calendar days in the payment period (less any scheduled breaks that are at least 5 days long)., The percent unearned is equal to 100 percent minus the percent earned., The assumption is that a student will attend the university for the full period in which the aid was awarded. If a student who is in receipt of US Federal Funding withdraws (officially or unofficially) from the university, we will determine on a pro-rata basis the amount of loan money to be returned to the Federal Student Aid Program., The student has earned 100% of financial aid if the R2T4 calculation results are more than 60% earned., Credit balance refund for withdrawn student must be put on hold until R2T4 is calculated. Regulatory timeframe for any credit balance resets to 14 days from the day you perform an R2T4 calculation. , A withdrawal from the Federal Loan Programme may affect your future financial aid eligibility and your personal finances. When a student withdraws, the college is required to calculate the amount of “unearned” funds to be returned. Unearned funds are calculated pro-rata, based on the number of days attended during the loan period, up to the official date of withdrawal. We will calculate the number of days attended as a percentage of the total number of days in the loan period. This determines the amount of “earned” funds, and any remaining “unearned” funds must be returned to the US Federal government., Post Withdrawal Disbursements, Total Disbursed Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned , Total Disbursed Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned, If the amount of aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, TCD will calculate a post-withdrawal disbursement If eligible, TCD will send email notification of the action required to either accept or decline a portion, or all of the late disbursement. If no response is received within two weeks the award will be cancelled., TCD must offer the student (or parent in the case of a Parent Plus loan) the PWD within 30 days of the Date of Determination and request confirmation that the PWD is accepted., TCD must within 30 days of the date of determination notify the student and parent in the case of a PLUS loan of the following points: The borrower may decline all or a portion of the loan disbursement. The School may request confirmation of any amount to be credited to the student’s account or directly disbursed to the borrower. • Advise the obligation to repay the loan. • Require a response of 14 days. • The School reserves the right to not disburse if the response is late. • If the school decides to not disburse, the borrower will be advised by email. • If the event of no response from the borrower, no disbursement of the PWD will be processed and the PWD will be returned to the Department of education., The borrower may decline all or a portion of the loan disbursement.

For the purposes of US Federal Aid a LOA is considered to be the equivalent of a withdrawal from TCD if it exceeds 180 days (6 months) in any 12-month period. The borrower will be considered as withdrawn from TCD for loan repayment purposes if they fail to return within the 180 day timeframe and at that point, the university is required to calculate the amount of financial aid the student earned and the amount of financial aid that must be returned., NOTE: If students cannot resume their education at the point they left off on approved/unapproved LOA irrelevant if it is within 180 days, the borrower will be considered as withdrawn from TCD for loan repayment purposes and the R2T4 is calculated if they withdraw within the term. , Information on the Trinity College Dublin LOA policy can be found on the Academic Registry student cases webpage.student cases webpage, https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/student-cases/, Example of return calculation: If a term last 60 days excluding any scheduled breaks and a students received €10,000 for the entire term but only attends 20 days they have only completed 33.3% of the term (€3,333 entitlement) and 66.7% of the funds are to be returned (€6667). This calculation is applied to the total amount disbursed for the loan period. Therefore, a student who received a refund (for living expenses etc.) from the college after tuition was deducted will be required to repay the “unearned” portion themselves. If a student never takes up attendance in Trinity we must return the monies which were due for disbursement. , Institutional Refund Policy, When a student withdraws, the college is required to return any “unearned” funds, up to the net amount disbursed from each source, in the following order:, Unsubsidized Direct Loans Subsidized Direct Loans Direct/Parent PLUS Loans , Unsubsidized Direct Loans, Subsidized Direct Loans, Direct/Parent PLUS Loans , The university return via G5 and you as the student may be required to return your own living expenses portion. TCD will notify students if they owe federal funds back to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Amounts that must be returned by the student will first be applied to federal loans. The student/parent will be permitted to repay loans based on the terms of the Master Promissory Note (MPN) which usually consists of scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time. Any overpayment the student has to return to the federal government must be repaid within 45 days after the student receives notification from TCD. If the overpayment cannot be paid in full, a repayment plan may be arranged with the U.S. Department of Education., Exit Counselling, You are required to undergo Exit Counselling during your final year, before you graduate., Also, if you withdraw from the college, or drop below half-time attendance, you are required by law to have Exit Counselling beforehand., Once complete you must send confirmation of exit counselling to the university., You can complete your Exit Counselling at the following link; https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action, https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action, ",

Federal law requires a Maximum Time frame of no more than 150% of the published length of the academic program in undergraduate programs. For undergraduate programs, 150% will be measured by credit hour. At each evaluation period (end of trimester), TCD will determine whether it is mathematically possible for a student to complete the program within maximum timeframe. This evaluation depends on number of credit hours left to complete within the remaining time or credits allotted for within the student’s maximum timeframe., Graduate Degree requirements - TCD determines the Maximum Time Frame for Graduate programs and follows the same principle of 150% of the published length of the academic program. , Note: The Quantitative measure is tied to the maximum timeframe. , Published length of degree programme Credits in degree programme Maximum timeframe to complete programme while receiving US Direct Loans 1 year (Postgraduate) 90 to 120 credits 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits 2 years (Postgraduate) 180 to 240 credits 3 years or 270 to 360 credits 4 years (Undergraduate) 240 to 270 credits 360 to 405 credits PhD 270 to 360 credits 6 years or 405 to 540 credits , Published length of degree programme Credits in degree programme Maximum timeframe to complete programme while receiving US Direct Loans , Credits in degree programme, Credits in degree programme, 1 year (Postgraduate) 90 to 120 credits 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits , 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits, 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits, Hours earned at Trinity College Dublin and accepted transfer hours are included in the calculation., 1 year degree – eligibility for aid 1.5 years 2 year degree – eligibility for aid 3 years 3 year degree – eligibility for aid 4.5 years 4 year degree – eligibility for aid 6 years 5 year degree – eligibility for aid 7.5 years , 1 year degree – eligibility for aid 1.5 years, 2 year degree – eligibility for aid 3 years, 3 year degree – eligibility for aid 4.5 years, 4 year degree – eligibility for aid 6 years, 5 year degree – eligibility for aid 7.5 years, The maximum timeframe is used to determine the pace of completion required to ensure that a student completes the program within the maximum timeframe:, The Maximum timeframe will be measured at each evaluation point. A student is ineligible at the evaluation point where indicated will exceed max timeframe NOT at the point when they reach the max timeframe., For an undergraduate program that requires 120 credit hours for completion, the maximum attempted hours would be 180 (120 x 150% = 180). For a graduate program that requires 60 credit hours for completion, the maximum hours would be 90 (60 x 150% = 90)., If you have exceeded the maximum time-frame to complete your degree program, you are not eligible for a Financial Aid Warning semester.

However, if a course is oversubscribed the university may not be in a position to automatically offer a place and the applicant may have to wait until there is a vacancy., There was a mistake in my Leaving Certificate results and I now have the points for the course., Any amendments to Leaving Certificate results will be notified to the Academic Registry by the CAO. We cannot act until we receive the formal notification from the CAO. As soon as the result is received we will re-assess the application and make an offer in the next round if a place is available.

This means that not all students on that points’ level were offered a place. To allow offers to be made fairly to students with the same number of points, a random number is generated when the points are being calculated and this ranks students in order. Random numbers range from 001 to 999., I got my first choice but I really want my second choice can I change?, No, it is unfortunately not possible to move down your list of course choices., Can I change courses once I register at Trinity College Dublin, It is possible to apply for an internal transfer. However, students must have the points and other requirements for the course into which they wish to transfer – transfer cannot be used as a “back door” into a course. Transfer is also subject to there being places available and therefore cannot be guaranteed. , More information can be found on our 'How to Apply' page under the 'applying for an internal transfer within Trinity College Dublin' tab. How to Apply, https://www.tcd.ie/study/apply/making-an-application/undergraduate/, CAO Deadlines, It is very important to be aware that CAO deadlines are absolute. If an applicant misses a deadline for accepting a place then they will have to write to the Admissions Officer outlining the reasons for not accepting on time. It may not be possible to automatically re-instate the place – it will depend on whether or not a course is full. Where it is possible to re-instate the place the student will not receive another offer.

            "Title": "Alternative Paths to Trinity - Feasibility Study in Admissions (Leaving Certificate)",
            "Content": "This Feasibility Study is only for students taking the Leaving Certificate examination. Feasibility Study places will only be offered in Round One of the CAO Admissions Process., For the ninth year, Trinity is pioneering a feasibility study in admission to see if there is a better and fairer mechanism to identify and admit applicants who are enthusiastic and passionate about learning, motivated and suitable for their chosen courses, and with the academic ability and potential to be inspired by everything that college has to offer. The admissions scheme tested in this study will adopt a holistic approach that has worked successfully internationally, using a range of materials to make an assessment about the academic ability and potential of each applicant., The new admissions route will be used to admit students on three courses - with ten places in History (TR003), ten places in Law (TR004), and five places in Ancient and Medieval History and Culture (TR028) filled using the new admissions route. Applicants to any of the three courses involved in the study will have the option of using the new admissions route, and submitting some supplementary materials (in which case they will be eligible for all of the regular places on the course filled in the traditional way, as well as the places set aside for the study), or opting out of the study, in which case they will remain eligible for all of the places allocated in the traditional way. Students applying for two or more of the courses in the study will only have to submit the supplementary information once., The feasibility study is being operated in partnership with the Central Applications Office (CAO) and all applications will be made completely anonymous before evaluation, to ensure the process is free from any external influences. The three modalities which will be used to assess applicants in the study are as follows:, (a) Leaving Certificate results., (b) Relative Performance Rank (RPR) – the performance of the applicant relative to other applicants from their school. This scale looks at the rank of the applicant compared to every other applicant from their school who has applied to any course, in any college, through the CAO., (c) Personal and Contextual Data – provided via supplementary materials submitted by the applicant., Applicants provide Personal and Contextual Data via a Personal Statement online. Personal statements are then reviewed by expert reviewers and used as a qualifier. Qualifying personal statements will be those which the reviewers score a 1, 2, 3, or 4 on a scale of 1 to 6. Applicants whose personal statements qualify according to the above will proceed to the next stage. In the scoring process, Leaving Certificate results and the Relative Performance Rank will be weighted equally and then the candidates will be ranked in order of their combined score for modalities (a) and (b)., Names of applicants, any identifying information, and the names of schools attended, will be made completely anonymous before being evaluated by the review panels. Applicants will be required to provide supplementary information requested in a Trinity Application Form. Applications must be submitted online through the CAO before 1 February. Additional documentation can be accepted until 1 March. Applicants are asked to submit an honest piece of self-reflection, discussing what they would like to study, and why, and this is what will be evaluated. Grammar, vocabulary, and writing style will not be scored., The feasibility study is an attempt to inform broader educational change by providing options to assist in the development of national policy and to see whether, on a small scale and in a strictly controlled way, it might be possible to admit students using a range of assessments (including the Leaving Certificate), with the results published and shared throughout the sector. It recognises the importance of having a Leaving Certificate examination that is fit-for-purpose and supports the reforms that are currently underway at second level to ensure a more positive educational experience. It also recognises and values the great work and commitment of the teachers at primary and second-level throughout Ireland., The admissions route tested here seeks to complement the role of the Leaving Certificate and the teaching community, by working with the Central Applications Office (CAO) to examine whether some approaches which have succeeded internationally might also work in an Irish context.",
