        "Title": "Federal Aid - Withdrawing from Trinity College Dublin ",
        "Content": "If you wish to withdraw from Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin the following process must be followed;, Undergraduate: https://www.tcd.ie/undergraduate-studies/academic-progress/ , Postgraduate: https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/student-cases/, Information about the Trinity College Dublin Refund policy can be found on the student finance webpage. The information can be found under the heading 'How Do I Claim a Refund'., Important: The TCD tuition/fee refund policy is separate from the Federal Regulations laid out below to repay unearned aid., Note: The return of Federal Loan Funds takes precedence over the college’s own tuition refund policy in the event of withdrawal. However, students should note that the return of loan funds does not cancel their liability to Trinity College Dublin for any tuition fee balance outstanding on their account. , , Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4), Timing of Calculation: Regulations require Trinity to perform calculations within 30 days from the date we determine a student has withdrawn. We must return the funds within 45 days of the calculation and the calculation must be performed within 30 days of the date of determination of withdrawal. Once the R2T4 calculation has been undertaken, TCD will issue a copy to the student by email., Calculation Method: The following formula is used to determine the percentage of unearned aid that has to be returned to the federal government:, The percent unearned is equal to 100 percent minus the percent earned., The assumption is that a student will attend the university for the full period in which the aid was awarded. If a student who is in receipt of US Federal Funding withdraws (officially or unofficially) from the university, we will determine on a pro-rata basis the amount of loan money to be returned to the Federal Student Aid Program., The student has earned 100% of financial aid if the R2T4 calculation results are more than 60% earned., Credit balance refund for withdrawn student must be put on hold until R2T4 is calculated. Regulatory timeframe for any credit balance resets to 14 days from the day you perform an R2T4 calculation. , A withdrawal from the Federal Loan Programme may affect your future financial aid eligibility and your personal finances. When a student withdraws, the college is required to calculate the amount of “unearned” funds to be returned. Unearned funds are calculated pro-rata, based on the number of days attended during the loan period, up to the official date of withdrawal. We will calculate the number of days attended as a percentage of the total number of days in the loan period. This determines the amount of “earned” funds, and any remaining “unearned” funds must be returned to the US Federal government., Post Withdrawal Disbursements, If the amount of aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, TCD will calculate a post-withdrawal disbursement If eligible, TCD will send email notification of the action required to either accept or decline a portion, or all of the late disbursement. If no response is received within two weeks the award will be cancelled., TCD must offer the student (or parent in the case of a Parent Plus loan) the PWD within 30 days of the Date of Determination and request confirmation that the PWD is accepted., TCD must within 30 days of the date of determination notify the student and parent in the case of a PLUS loan of the following points: The borrower may decline all or a portion of the loan disbursement. The School may request confirmation of any amount to be credited to the student’s account or directly disbursed to the borrower. • Advise the obligation to repay the loan. • Require a response of 14 days. • The School reserves the right to not disburse if the response is late. • If the school decides to not disburse, the borrower will be advised by email. • If the event of no response from the borrower, no disbursement of the PWD will be processed and the PWD will be returned to the Department of education., , A Leave of Absence (LOA) should be only a temporary interruption to a student's programme of study. For the purposes of US Federal Aid a LOA is considered to be the equivalent of a withdrawal from TCD if it exceeds 180 days (6 months) in any 12-month period. The borrower will be considered as withdrawn from TCD for loan repayment purposes if they fail to return within the 180 day timeframe and at that point, the university is required to calculate the amount of financial aid the student earned and the amount of financial aid that must be returned., NOTE: If students cannot resume their education at the point they left off on approved/unapproved LOA irrelevant if it is within 180 days, the borrower will be considered as withdrawn from TCD for loan repayment purposes and the R2T4 is calculated if they withdraw within the term. , Information on the Trinity College Dublin LOA policy can be found on the Academic Registry student cases webpage., Example of return calculation: If a term last 60 days excluding any scheduled breaks and a students received €10,000 for the entire term but only attends 20 days they have only completed 33.3% of the term (€3,333 entitlement) and 66.7% of the funds are to be returned (€6667). This calculation is applied to the total amount disbursed for the loan period. Therefore, a student who received a refund (for living expenses etc.) from the college after tuition was deducted will be required to repay the “unearned” portion themselves. If a student never takes up attendance in Trinity we must return the monies which were due for disbursement. , Institutional Refund Policy, When a student withdraws, the college is required to return any “unearned” funds, up to the net amount disbursed from each source, in the following order:, The university return via G5 and you as the student may be required to return your own living expenses portion. TCD will notify students if they owe federal funds back to the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Amounts that must be returned by the student will first be applied to federal loans. The student/parent will be permitted to repay loans based on the terms of the Master Promissory Note (MPN) which usually consists of scheduled payments to the holder of the loan over a period of time. Any overpayment the student has to return to the federal government must be repaid within 45 days after the student receives notification from TCD. If the overpayment cannot be paid in full, a repayment plan may be arranged with the U.S. Department of Education., Exit Counselling, You are required to undergo Exit Counselling during your final year, before you graduate., Also, if you withdraw from the college, or drop below half-time attendance, you are required by law to have Exit Counselling beforehand., Once complete you must send confirmation of exit counselling to the university., You can complete your Exit Counselling at the following link; https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action , "

        "Title": "Federal Aid - Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP)",
        "Content": "Policy For Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) – Title IV Eligibility for Student Receiving Title IV (FSA) Federal Student Aid (Direct Subsidised, Unsubsidised, Grad Plus and Parent Plus loans)., , 1. Overview, Satisfactory Academic Progress 668.34 (a) Satisfactory Academic Progress policy., Trinity College Dublin must establish a reasonable satisfactory academic progress policy for determining whether an otherwise eligible student is making satisfactory academic progress in his or her educational program for each academic year and may receive assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs., Students wishing to apply for and receive Title IV assistance (Direct Subsidised, Unsubsidised, Grad PLUS and Parent PLUS loans) must meet specific academic progress requirements in order to maintain Title IV financial aid eligibility., Note: The same academic standards apply for (SAP) for students in receipt of US Federal Student Aid as apply for other students who are not in receipt of US FSA. The policy provides for consistent application of standards to all students within categories of students, e.g. full-time, part-time, undergraduate, and graduate students, and educational programs established by the school. Satisfactory academic progress requires a student to accumulate a minimum number of credit hours over a maximum timeframe and a minimum cumulative grade point average for each period of attendance. The standards apply to undergraduate and postgraduate students in receipt of Federal Student Aid and studying at Trinity College Dublin on full-time and part-time programmes., Courses where a portion is based in the USA. An exception may be made for PhD students conducting research at a US institution where that research cannot be conducted in Trinity College Dublin. Satisfactory Academic Progress is determined by:, 2. (Quantitative Measurement), Students must complete attempted hours according to the following, *i.e. 12 hours attempted, 8 hours must be completed (8/12 = 67%), 3. (Qualitative Measurement), Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade of Third Class Honors III between 40% and 49%., Information on grading guidelines can be found on the Trinity College Dublin study options page., For undergraduate programs of more than 2 academic years, the student must at the end of the second academic year have a minimum grade scale of 40% - 49% as is consistent with the grading guidelines requirement for graduation in order to meet SAP. , 4. Maximum Timeframe, The Maximum timeframe will be measured at each evaluation point. A student is ineligible at the evaluation point where indicated will exceed max timeframe NOT at the point when they reach the max timeframe., Undergraduate Degree requirements must be completed within a Maximum Timeframe. Federal law requires a Maximum Time frame of no more than 150% of the published length of the academic program in undergraduate programs. For undergraduate programs, 150% will be measured by credit hour. At each evaluation period (end of trimester), TCD will determine whether it is mathematically possible for a student to complete the program within maximum timeframe. This evaluation depends on number of credit hours left to complete within the remaining time or credits allotted for within the student’s maximum timeframe., Graduate Degree requirements - TCD determines the Maximum Time Frame for Graduate programs and follows the same principle of 150% of the published length of the academic program. , Note: The Quantitative measure is tied to the maximum timeframe. , Published length of degree programme Credits in degree programme Maximum timeframe to complete programme while receiving US Direct Loans 1 year (Postgraduate) 90 to 120 credits 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits 2 years (Postgraduate) 180 to 240 credits 3 years or 270 to 360 credits 4 years (Undergraduate) 240 to 270 credits 360 to 405 credits PhD 270 to 360 credits 6 years or 405 to 540 credits , Published length of degree programme Credits in degree programme Maximum timeframe to complete programme while receiving US Direct Loans , Credits in degree programme, Credits in degree programme, 1 year (Postgraduate) 90 to 120 credits 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits , 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits, 1.5 years or 135 to 180 credits, Hours earned at Trinity College Dublin and accepted transfer hours are included in the calculation., The maximum timeframe is used to determine the pace of completion required to ensure that a student completes the program within the maximum timeframe:, The Maximum timeframe will be measured at each evaluation point. A student is ineligible at the evaluation point where indicated will exceed max timeframe NOT at the point when they reach the max timeframe., For an undergraduate program that requires 120 credit hours for completion, the maximum attempted hours would be 180 (120 x 150% = 180). For a graduate program that requires 60 credit hours for completion, the maximum hours would be 90 (60 x 150% = 90)., If you have exceeded the maximum time-frame to complete your degree program, you are not eligible for a Financial Aid Warning semester. You are no longer eligible to receive financial aid unless you win an appeal. , 5. SAP Monitoring, Trinity Academic Year is divided into 3 terms. Michaelmas (autumn), Hilary (spring), and Trinity (summer). , A student’s SAP will be evaluated at the end of each term. All periods of attendance will be included in this evaluation regardless of whether the student received financial aid. This evaluation will include a measurement of student’s progress set forth in the qualitative standards (Grade %) and quantitative standards (credits). A student who fails to meet SAP standards at the end of the term will be notified by email that they are being placed on Financial Aid Warning., 6. Financial Aid Warning If a student fails to meet the minimum requirements as stated in the qualitative and quantitative section, the student will be placed on financial aid warning. Financial Aid Warning is a status assigned if you were previously meeting SAP policy standards, however at the last SAP review, you failed to make satisfactory academic progress. This is an alert to inform you that if the SAP policy standards are not met during the warning semester, you will no longer be eligible for future financial aid. Students cannot be placed on a Financial Aid Warning for two consecutive periods. The SAP status is checked at the end of each semester, including summer. At the end of your Financial Aid Warning semester, your SAP status will be re- evaluated to determine if the requirements of the SAP policy have been met. You must be meeting the SAP policy requirements to continue to receive financial aid. Otherwise, you will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension and will not be eligible to receive financial aid. Good Standing – eligible to receive financial aid If the overall SAP Policy requirements are met at the end of the probationary semester, your SAP status will be updated to ‘good standing’ (making satisfactory academic progress) beginning with the next semester. You will be eligible to receive federal aid. Financial Aid Suspension – not eligible to receive financial aid if the overall SAP Policy requirements are not met at the end of the Financial Aid Warning semester, then you be placed on Financial Aid Suspension and you will be suspended from receiving any financial aid beginning with the next semester and for future semesters until the SAP Policy requirements have once again been met. Any federal student aid previously awarded for the upcoming semester will be cancelled. You may submit a SAP Appeal to request to have you financial aid reinstated. 7. Appeal A student has the right to appeal if he/she feels that he/she has complied with the requirements of the satisfactory academic progress policy or believes that there are extenuating circumstances that occurred. Examples of extenuating circumstance are the death of a relative, an injury or illness to an immediate family member or student, or similar special circumstances that could affect the academic performance. To appeal a financial aid suspension, the student must submit a written appeal within 10 calendar days of receipt of the notice of suspension. Written appeals should be sent to the Financial Aid Officer at Acadreg_fedaid@tcd.ie and include all supporting documentation. Students may appeal ineligibility by providing information on extenuating circumstances which may have caused a deterioration in academic performance, and by indicating what has changed in order to bring about SAP. In this event, extenuating circumstances must be serious in nature and documentary evidence must be provided. Submission of an appeal is not an automatic approval. If the appeal is denied, the student will be ineligible to receive Title IV aid until the academic requirements are met. Appeals will be acknowledged as received within 48 hours of receipt of the appeal, and the appellant will receive a decision within 5 working days of the receipt of appeal date. Federal Student Aid funding will not be disbursed while an appeal is being considered. 8. Probationary Periods If the student’s appeal is granted, the student will be placed on Financial Aid Probation and will have the next succeeding term of enrolment (semester) to meet the minimum requirements as stated above. At the conclusion of the term, the financial aid officer will ensure the student is now meeting the SAP standards in order to qualify for further federal financial aid funding. If the student is not making SAP standards again at that time, the student will be placed on financial aid suspension again and be required to submit a new appeal, including an academic plan. 9. Academic Plan An academic plan will be completed between the student and Academic Advisor. Academic Plans are submitted each term that a student is approved to return resulting from a successful appeal of a financial aid suspension.

        "Title": "FAQS - Student Annual Registration",
        "Content": "How do I complete registration?, Students will receive an in-tray message to their my.tcd.ie portal, advising them that registration is open. The student should then click on the “Register” tab in the left hand corner of their portal and complete all of the tasks shown. As each task is completed the red X beside the task will turn to a green tick. When all tasks have been completed the student will then be fully registered, and will be prompted to print a “Confirmation of Registration” document. This document should be presented at the dedicated ID Card Issue Desk or the Academic Registry Service Desk (in the case of March new entrants) to obtain a new student ID card. Please note that the payment of fees on the my.tcd.ie portal does not constitute registration. Students must complete the registration process via the my.tcd.ie portal every year., I am having difficulties registering. Who should I contact?, Students who have any difficulty in completing the online registration process should call to the Academic Registry for assistance, or may submit an enquiry with the subject title ‘Registration Query’ via email (academic.registry@tcd.ie) or by clicking the ASK AR button on the registration screen. , Where can I get a Trinity Student ID card? How much does it cost?, To apply for a student ID card, or TCard you must first complete registration. You can apply for your card on the TCard website. The Trinity student ID card is free, but a replacement card costs €20 and can be purchased at the Academic Registry service desk in the Watts Building., To find out more about getting a Trinity Student ID card, you can watch our video below. , I sat supplemental exams and I have not been invited to register., A passing grade is required to be uploaded to a student’s record before the student can be invited to register. Therefore, students who sit supplemental exams will be invited to register at a later stage than students who passed the annual exams. Invitations to register are usually issued towards the end of September for students who have taken supplemental exams and received a passing grade., I spent the last academic year on an exchange programme and I have not been invited to register., Students who were on ERASMUS exchanges or visiting other institutions the previous year will be invited to register subject to the publication of a result for that academic year. Such students awaiting the publication of results should contact their School or Course Office in the first instance., To find out more about registration, you can watch our video below. , "

        "Title": "FAQS - General Undergraduate Admissions ",
        "Content": "How do I apply?, Information on how to apply can be found on the Study at Trinity website. Students should determine whether they are EU or non-EU and follow the application procedure based on their status. EU or non-EU status does not refer to your citizenship but refers to your residency. Application routes differ depending on your status. , Am I an EU or non-EU applicant - how is this determined?, Guidelines for determining EU/non-EU status can be found under the 'Personal Fee Status' tab on our Undergraduate Fees and Finances page. , HEA Free Fees Scheme - do I qualify and what documentation do I need?, In order to qualify for the Irish Free Fees Initiative you must have been living in the EU for at least 3 of the 5 years before starting your course., More information about documentation and student eligibility can be found under the 'Personal Fee Status' tab on our Undergraduate Fees and Finances page. , What are the course fees and am I eligible for any assistance?, Information on course fees and college funding, for both EU and non-EU students can be found on the Student Finances page., Applicants can find information on the HEA website. , How do I apply as an EU Visiting Student?, Information on eligibility as well as application forms for EU Visiting Students can be downloaded from our Erasmus & EU Exchange page., When is the deadline for receipt of applications?, The closing date is the 1st March for entry the following September. , However, the applications for the spring term (Hilary Term) entry is 30th September., How much will it cost to study at Trinity as an EU Visiting student?, EU Students who are spending a year at Trinity as an integral part of their degree abroad are eligible for a fee remission and will only be required to pay the Student Contribution. In addition students are required to pay the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) membership levy and the Student Sports Centre charge, but will not be liable for tuition fees if approved for the Free Fees scheme., In order to be eligible for this tuition fee remission, EU students must be attending Trinity College Dublin for their 2nd, 3rd or 4th year of university study and must provide evidence that their Module of study at Trinity College would be fully recognised by their home universities as part of their degree. (This applies to full-time undergraduate students only).The Academic Registry will provide a form for this purpose once a place has been offered. , Are there English Language proficiency entry requirements?, A high level of competence in the English language is required to study at Trinity College Dublin. A list of our English language requirements can be found at our Entry Requirements for International Students page., I will not have the opportunity to take an English Language Proficiency test before the 1st of March. Is it possible for me to send the results after the closing date?, Yes. Results can be sent after the application, and provisional offers can be made without them., Can I take modules in more than one department while at Trinity?, Yes. It is usual for Visiting Students to take modules in two or three departments and sometimes four., How do I enroll for modules at Trinity?, You can discuss module choices with your department upon arrival at Trinity College Dublin. Students will not be accepted into specific modules prior to arrival unless they have listed as \"required\" on their application form, and have been accepted into that department. , Visit our online module enrolment page for more information., Does acceptance into a particular department mean I can take whatever modules I wish?, If you have been accepted into a particular department, for which you have listed modules as “required”, then yes, you will be guaranteed a place in these modules. However, acceptance into various departments means you will be offered modules on arrival following discussion with the appropriate lecturers. You may not be offered all of the modules you wish to take., Visit our online module enrolment page for more information., Where can I get information on modules available to me?, For visiting students, you can find more information on our visiting student module enrolment page., Can I apply to the Semester Start-Up Programme (SSP)?, At present the Semester Start-Up Programme is only available to non-EU Visiting Students., Find out more.

        "Title": "FAQS - CAO Application",
        "Content": "I have the points but I did not get an offer?, Points are not the only criteria that determine whether an offer can be made. Applicants are advised to check that they have met the minimum entry requirements or course specific requirements for the course they have not received an offer for. Some common reasons for not receiving an offer are listed below: An applicant’s results do not include English, Mathematics or a language OR they do not satisfy the course requirements. Applicants from other EU countries must satisfy the English Language qualification outlined on the Admission Requirements page under the 'English Language Requirements' tab. The course(s) for which the applicant applied has an interview/test e.g. Drama, Music, Adelaide (TR093), Medicine (HPAT-Ireland). If the applicant did not pass their interview they will be ineligible to receive an offer. The applicant has not provided their final results. The CAO automatically receives the Leaving Certificate and most A Level results. Applicants who are presenting other examinations (e.g. French Baccalaureate, German Abitur etc.) must submit a certified copy of their results to the CAO. Information on how to apply as a Mature Student can be found on the 'How to Apply' page on the Mature Students webpage. , My results were not available on time for Round One and I have the points for the course – will I definitely get an offer in Round Two?, If the results were not submitted by the applicant in time and there are places available after Round One, an offer will be issued. However, if a course is oversubscribed the university may not be in a position to automatically offer a place and the applicant may have to wait until there is a vacancy., There was a mistake in my Leaving Certificate results and I now have the points for the course., Any amendments to Leaving Certificate results will be notified to the Academic Registry by the CAO. We cannot act until we receive the formal notification from the CAO. As soon as the result is received we will re-assess the application and make an offer in the next round if a place is available. If not, a deferred place for the following year may be offered at the discretion of the Admissions Officer. , (Note: This applies when the applicant has been notified of a mistake rather than where an applicant has specifically applied for a re-check of their marks.), I got my 4th course choice on my CAO – what are the chances of getting a higher offer in the next round?, Offers will only be made in subsequent rounds if places are still available. , Offers may be made in subsequent rounds only if applicants do not accept places in Round One, therefore it is not possible to predict whether or not places will be available., I am planning to get my results rechecked. If I have enough points after the re-check, am I guaranteed a place on my chosen course?, If, as a result of the re-check process, an applicant receives an upgrade which brings their results to the points required for a course, we will do everything we can to offer a place. However, the results of the re-check process are not issued until early October at which time most courses are full and sometimes it may not be possible to accommodate additional students. In this case, the student will be offered a deferred place for the following year., I want to defer my place. What do I have to do?, Applicants who have received an offer from the CAO may apply to defer their entry. On receipt of the offer the applicant must do two things:, Deferrals will not be granted to applicants who wish to take up a place in another third level institution in Ireland or elsewhere; or where a student is repeating the Leaving Certificate. , What is Random Selection?, If you look at the list of minimum entry levels you will notice that some points scores have an * beside them. This means that not all students on that points’ level were offered a place. To allow offers to be made fairly to students with the same number of points, a random number is generated when the points are being calculated and this ranks students in order. Random numbers range from 001 to 999., I got my first choice but I really want my second choice can I change?, No, it is unfortunately not possible to move down your list of course choices., Can I change courses once I register at Trinity College Dublin, It is possible to apply for an internal transfer. However, students must have the points and other requirements for the course into which they wish to transfer – transfer cannot be used as a “back door” into a course. Transfer is also subject to there being places available and therefore cannot be guaranteed. , More information can be found on our 'How to Apply' page under the 'applying for an internal transfer within Trinity College Dublin' tab. , CAO Deadlines, It is very important to be aware that CAO deadlines are absolute. If an applicant misses a deadline for accepting a place then they will have to write to the Admissions Officer outlining the reasons for not accepting on time. It may not be possible to automatically re-instate the place – it will depend on whether or not a course is full. Where it is possible to re-instate the place the student will not receive another offer. TCD will request CAO to record a late acceptance for the student., "
