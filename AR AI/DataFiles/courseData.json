        "Overview": "It is well established that a healthy workforce is a happier one, with low levels of absenteeism and greater productivity. Never has this been more relevant than in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Employers across the public and private sector are developing ‘healthy workplace’ policies to support the health and wellbeing of their employees.This masterclass will introduce an evidence based 8-step framework for designing, implementing, improving, and sustaining a workplace well-being programme. Many Irish organisations have an annual programme of ‘random acts of wellness’ in place, which cannot be measured and lead to no tangible benefits for employees or the organisation. This masterclass will highlight what constitutes an effective well-being programme and how a properly crafted programme can boost not only the health of your colleagues, but also your organisation’s bottom line.13th September 2021, 6-9pmDelivered as a live webinar via Zoom.3-hour webinarOnline",

        "Overview": "Human beings have always been on the move: sometimes by choice as colonisers, traders or travellers, and at other times by necessity, as migrants escaping difficult or dangerous circumstance or seeking better opportunities. Migration, the movement of people from one place to another, can be voluntary or forced, temporary or permanent, and may be driven by a complex range of factors including economic, social, political, or environmental considerations. Colonisation, on the other hand, refers to the acquisition of new lands and resources and is often accompanied by the subjugation of one group of people by another through military force. Conquests have been a common feature throughout human history and may be motivated by the desire to acquire new territory, wealth, power or resources, or in the pursuit of religious or ideological goals, sometimes leading to forced migration to new lands.This series of sixteen lectures (eight in each term) will explore the history of human migration from prehistory to the present-day global migration crisis and will examine the social, economic, cultural, religious and political factors that have driven migration. Lectures will cover a wide range of topics including why people migrate, the impact of migration on societies, customs and cultures, the effects of physical changes to the urban and rural landscapes as well as the challenges faced by both migrant and host communities.Lectures will be given by experts in their field from the School of Histories and Humanities and will give a unique, long-term perspective on one of the most important issues of our times.How to apply:You may apply online or by *phone as follows: ONLINE: You may register and pay online at http://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses AFTER enrolments openBy telephone: Please text ‘APPLY FOR COURSE’ to 087 257 2015* and you will receive a call back.Please note that the phone will be very busy during the application period so there may be a delay in replying to your call.

        "Overview": "This is a three-year, full-time, intensive honours degree for anyone who is serious about acting and wants to become an actor. The structure and contents of this degree have been designed in consultation with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London and consists of a practical skills based course that enables students to learn by doing. The UK and Ireland’s leading theatre practitioners form the core panel of teachers within The Lir Academy and a number of visiting international directors, actors, playwrights and producers are regularly scheduled to take workshops, manage projects and lend their expertise to the learning experience. Students will be taught in acting technique, voice, movement, and singing, as well as complementary classes in dramaturgy and text analysis, over six semesters (two per annum) to ‘over nine terms (three per annum)Being an acting student at The Lir Academy at Trinity is completely different to being a student on other drama courses. While students of degree courses in drama might be in taught classes for approximately 14 hours per week, students at The Lir Academy can expect to be in classes, workshops and rehearsals on average for 35 hours per week, and sometimes more when in production. Training for the theatre at The Lir Academy is founded on the basic principle of simulating the working environment of a professional theatre.The teaching is intense and offers a high degree of individual tuition. Acting students are expected to maintain a healthy lifestyle in order to cope with the physical demands and stamina required by the training.Only students who are fully committed to pursuing a career as a professional actor should consider this course. Students who are unsure of their career path at this stage should consider applying for the Diploma in Acting and Theatre at The Lir Academy, Drama Studies (JH) or TR025 Drama and Theatre Studies.The Lir Academy was developed by the partnership of the Cathal Ryan Trust and Trinity and opened its doors to the first students in September 2011. The depth and breadth of the training is enhanced by guest lectures and workshops from leading international figures of stage and screen.The training offered by The Lir Academy takes place in a custom built building at Grand Canal Quay, designed specifically for a range of courses in acting, design, directing, lighting design, stage management, technical theatre and playwriting.The course is specifically designed to train actors for the theatre, TV and Film. All the training is provided by dedicated theatre professionals with strong industry links. All of the final year productions and showcases are designed to attract international employment opportunities for the students. There is a strong emphasis in the training on career preparation, and students will be taught not only how to work as an actor but also how to sustain a career as an actor.This course trains students for careers in professional theatre and related industries. A strong emphasis is placed on training the actor’s body as an instrument, as well as nurturing the actor’s creative imagination. It is physically demanding and requires a high level of stamina. In the third and final year of the course students will be cast in at least 5 productions, 1 short film and an audition showcase (in Dublin and London) over the course of the year which are performed in front of agents, directors, producers and the general public.Students in the first two years of the course take compulsory modules in Acting and Text, Movement Studies and Voice Studies. Teaching is by practical workshop and delivered by professional practitioners. In addition there is considerable individual tuition to supplement the workshops in all aspects of the course. Students will also be introduced to the techniques of acting for recorded media (film, radio, television). At the end of second year, students will combine all the skills developed over the two years of training in their first ensemble production to an invited audience.Students will be cast in a series of 5 theatre productions, directed by professional theatre directors. Each production will have multiple performances over a 7-day period and will play to invited agents, directors, producers, as well as the general public. Students will also be cast in a short film, directed by a professional film director and filmed both on set and on location. The films will receive a public screening. Students will also perform an audition showcase in both Dublin and London before an invited audience of agents and directors.Assessment in the first and second years is based entirely on a series of practical class presentations in all modules. In third year, assessment is by a series of public performances.Click here for further information on modules/subject.www.thelir.ieEmail: admissions@thelir.ieTel: +353 1 896 2559Facebook: www.facebook.com/TheLirAcademy/Twitter: @TheLirAcademy",

Postgraduate Certificate will also deliver significant content related to how to assess and manage the frail older adult in a clinical setting, including clinical training sessions. Furthermore, graduates of this Postgraduate Certificate will experience how to apply this theoretical and clinical knowledge to a research setting and learn how this research translates back to a clinical setting. The programme consists of four modules• The Biology of the Ageing Process • Frailty in Ageing Adults • Frailty in Ageing Adults: Clinical Practice and• Quantitative Analytical Tools for Ageing and Frailty The course is taught by the Discipline of Medical Gerontology within the School of Medicine using in-person learning, as well as online-learning through the College Virtual Learning Environment. The Discipline of Medical Gerontology at Trinity has a wealth of expertise in ageing biology, clinical frailty assessment and management, and in frailty research. We have built on this expertise to create a Postgraduate Certificate that focuses on understanding the ageing process, how dysregulation of physiological systems can lead to frailty, and why these frailty-associated physiological changes leave the older adult more vulnerable to additional morbidity and mortality. The time commitment for the online lectures will be (term times during 1 year):Tuesdays 3-5 pm Irish TimeFridays 2-4 pm Irish TimeLectures will be recorded.Module 1: The Biology of the Ageing Process (10 ECTs; Semester 1)The aim of this module is to provide an overview of what happens to the body during the ageing process. It will provide a general overview to the ageing process and will focus on some of the key mechanisms of ageing. There will be focus on how age-associated physiological changes leave us more susceptible to developing diseases as we age. There will be a focus on biological determinants and stressors that accelerate the ageing process and detail how they exert their effects on the systems of the body. The module will explain the important differences between chronological and biological age and focus on the factors that can influence our rate of ageing. There will be a focus on the immune system and how age-related changes to immunity leads to increased susceptibility to diseases. The objectives of this module are:• Describe what happens to the body during the ageing process• Demonstrate knowledge of major theories of ageing• Understand the concept of biological vs chronological ageing• Outline how certain stressors can drive accelerated ageing• Discuss the role that genetics plays in the ageing process• Understand age associated changes in immunity and how inflammation plays a major role in age related diseases• Discuss the physiological changes associated with major age associated diseases and how changes to lifestyle can mitigate disease development and pathologyThe content of this module will be delivered through 10 lectures on Friday afternoons (2 – 4pm) throughout semester 1 Module 2: Frailty in Ageing Adults (5 ECTs)The Aims of this module are:• Describe the clinical concept of frailty in ageing adults.• Recognise the biological underpinnings of frailty in ageing adults.• Differentiate the various operationalisations of frailty in ageing adults.• Identify the relevance and importance of the assessment of frailty in healthcare settings.• Outline the principles of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in the management of frailty and geriatric syndromes.• Describe the application of CGA for the management of frailty in special specialty scenarios (e.g. surgery, oncology).• Describe the application of CGA for the management of frailty in special patient groups (e.g. HIV, intellectual disabilities).The content of this lecture will be delivered through 10 lectures on afternoons throughout semester 1.Module 3: Frailty in Ageing Adults: Clinical Practice (5 ECTs)The aim of this module is to provide an overview of the clinical assessment of key geriatric/frailty syndromes with an emphasis on the practical use of common geriatric assessment tools and their practical integration through the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment method.This module examines the assessment of four major geriatric syndromes across care settings:• Mobility, disability and falls risk assessment• Assessment of cognitive impairment, dementia and delirium• Assessment and management of polypharmacy with an emphasis on appropriate prescribing tools• Transitions between care settings including hospital discharge planning processesThe above practical sessions will culminate in a session where the student will have an opportunity to integrate a variety of clinical assessments via a simulated Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment.Students will undergo practical tutorials on components of frailty assessment in a clinical environment. Students will be supervised and guided by clinical consultants in the four geriatric syndromes. Students will also undertake virtual workshops on implementing frailty services in their clinical practice. The content of this module will be delivered through 7 practical tutorials and 3 virtual tutorials on Tuesday afternoons (3 – 5pm) throughout semester 2.Module 4: Quantitative Analytical Tools for Ageing and Frailty (10 ECTs; Semester 2)The Aims of this module are:• Provide a theoretical overview of statistical methods used in the operationalisation of frailty-related parameters• Introduce students to statistical analysis software (Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS))• Provide students with an overview on navigating SPSS software.• Provide detailed guidance on performing descriptive analysis using simple datasets, along with more complex bivariate and multivariate regression techniques using SPSS.• Introduce the TILDA dataset and relevant to frailty analysis therein• Provide overview on operationalising frailty models in SPSS using consolidated theoretical knowledge from earlier modules and new knowledge on analysis techniques from the current module.The content of this module will be delivered through 7 lectures and 3 virtual tutorials on Friday afternoons (2 – 4pm) throughout semester 2.AssessmentAttendance to taught sessions and practicals. Students will have assignments and/or exams for each module. The final mark is based on a credit-weighted average of the mark awarded in each module with a pass mark of 50% requiredGraduates will be able to progress through advanced/specialist gerontological practice routes where available.

        "Overview": " Who is this Micro-credential for? • If you work with spatial data and maps and would like to have the ability to analyse this data and create your own maps and new spatial information, then this micro-credential is for you. • Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used in many professions and industries, from engineering and environmental science to history and tourism to local authorities and provision of utilities, wherever spatial information is important, where maps may be used as a key means of communication of information, and where analysis of the spatial data provides valuable new information.Why should I take this Micro-credential? • This micro-credential will enable the student to get a practical introduction to the QGIS open-source software and will use the software to address an issue in their field. Examples of projects completed by students recently include the identification of the best location for a new waste-to-energy plant, a study of the relationship between tree cover and household income, the siting of a new mass-vaccination centre, a study of the effect of green-ways on the local population. In each of these, publicly available spatial data was used to investigate a topical issue.• The production of good informative maps and the analysis of spatial data are valuable but scarce skill sets. With developments in GPS, mobile devices, and software, organisations are now collecting more and more spatial data and need spatial specialists to manage, analyse and report this data. Local authorities, civil engineering consultancies, environmental agencies, utility companies, among others, are increasing their use of GIS to manage their valuable spatial data.• Our Micro-credentials are all CPD approved by Engineers IrelandWhen can I start this Micro-credential? • There is one intake per year in SeptemberWhat do I need to be accepted onto this Micro-credential? - Entry requirements & Prerequisite documents • Level 8 award 2.1 grade in Engineering, Science or any discipline in which GIS may be used. Computer skills such as proficiency in Excel are essential.• Degree Parchment or transcript • Curriculum VitaeWhat will I learn? • Participants will learn the extended fundamentals of GIS theory and techniques and will then apply these in a research project which is in a field related to their profession and uses GIS.• In this work, they will investigate and solve Spatial Analysis problems by applying the latest interdisciplinary approaches. They will critically select and implement a technical solution that best addresses a spatial analysis problem. They will identify and use appropriate mathematical methods, numerical techniques, and GIS tools for application to new and ill-defined spatial analysis problems.• In addition, they will show that they can communicate effectively in technical and scientific writing, and present scientific/technical ideas concisely to a technical audience that may not be expert in the specific domain of the presentation.What will I do? • In the first six weeks, six one-hour lectures provide an overview of GIS. In six two-hour tutorial sessions, students follow guided tutorials and must submit an exercise within seven days. Feedback is provided on these, but the marks do not count towards the final grade.• The seventh week is Reading Week.• In the eighth week, a one-hour in-class GIS theory test is conducted, and a two-hour in-class practical test is held.• In weeks nine to twelve, students work on their projects in the two-hour practical sessions. They will be expected to share their weekly progress on their project at the practical sessions. In this way, the students will learn from their own work, the work of other students, and assistance and advice from the staff.How will this Micro-credential be delivered? • Blended - complementary online and in-personHow is this Micro-credential assessed? • Project 90%: Students are required to complete a report based upon the work conducted for their individual project. The report should be approximately 3,000-4,000 words. Students will be provided with detailed guidance on writing the report.• In-class theory test 5% • In-class practical test 5%",

        "Overview": "The MPhil (Master’s Degree), Post Graduate Diploma (PGDip) and Post Graduate Certificate (PGCert) in Applied Intercultural Communications are designed as both stand-alone and linked courses through the top-up progression. They are delivered by the Centre for Global Intercultural Communications at Trinity College Dublin and are part of the postgraduate suite of courses in the School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies.Why Applied Intercultural Communications?The significance of the increase in global mobility is unquestionable. In many workplaces, cultural diversity is currently the norm. Intercultural communication plays an important role in the functioning of societies, organisations and in individual performance. However, whilst working in a culturally diverse environment makes interpersonal, social and professional interactions more interesting and exciting, cross-cultural communication comes with its challenges. The cultures in which people have been brought up and our intercultural encounters influence the way we communicate. Anxiety, disorientation, and exclusion are common consequences of miscommunication across and between cultures. In a globalised world, any attempt to optimise intercultural communications requires a good understanding of the role of self and social awareness in the interpretation of cultural dimensions. The interplay between sociability, solidarity and inclusion in specific professional and wider social contexts determines and drives the sustainability, fairness and success of human interactions. Developing intercultural competences is vital for advancing equitable global collaborations between society, industry and academia.Applied focusOur applied mode relies on the use of case studies to illustrate how intercultural communication works on the ground in global contexts. The programmes combine international case studies, student-led case studies and practical activities, based on the participants’ experiences. The applied focus is complemented by theory, research and practice-driven components, potentially linking African, Asian, Latin American and Caribbean, and Middle Eastern case studies to European and North American cultures and contexts. Students gain an understanding of the concepts and models related to intercultural communication and learn how to apply Equality, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EEDI) perspectives and digital literacy to develop equitable collaborations and partnerships with people from different backgrounds.What will you learn in these programmes?The programmes will provide participants with novel perspectives and methods for effective intercultural communication at work, strategic partnerships, inclusive leadership and global engagement.Upon successful completion of this course, participants will be able to:• Communicate effectively within multicultural teams, showing an appreciation of different cultural perspectives and values• Engage in collaborative learning and apply digital literacy and communicative features to produce a critical reflective account underpinned by a global outlook• Relate the analysis of cultural diversity to different cultural perspectives in a variety of social and professional contexts• Design, write, carry out and discuss research reflecting an understanding of the state of the art, using appropriate research methods to support professional practices• Design, analyse, reflect and present a project to diverse audiences using multiple media and platforms• Identify research topics; formulate hypotheses and questions; conduct literature review that highlights the gaps; and carry out a study that contributes to the body of knowledge, including the understanding and the improvement of intercultural and professional practices• Use the knowledge and skills gained for further research and programmes of study in applied intercultural communications and related areas.Who is this course for?These programmes will be of interest to organisations and individuals wishing to further develop their skills, careers and business opportunities by applying intercultural communication methods to succeed in multicultural contexts. Our flexible course delivery, through full time, part time and multiple entry route options, will enable students to develop effective intercultural communication skills for successful engagements with diverse audiences. We accept a range of students who bring different experiential learning abilities. Thus, the programme could equally suit those looking for reskilling and upskilling opportunities, either in employment already or seeking new horizons. Therefore, it is likely that a class could be shared with leaders, entrepreneurs, employers and employees and others looking for postgraduate training and education to acquire competency in applied intercultural communications for the workforce. Our flexible learning modalities include both online and face-to-face contact, with a view to supporting active learning and successful learner engagement in academic provisions.Applicants have the choice between three parallel points of entry and two progression routes:1. One-year full-time MPhil (Master’s) (90 ECTS) which also offers an exit award of Postgraduate Diploma upon completion of 60 ECTS, without the MPhil (Master’s) dissertation.2. One-year full-time Postgraduate Diploma (60 ECTS). This option also enables progression to the MPhil (Master’s) Top up of 30 credits in year 2.3. Part-time options over three years, students can stop and resume studies according to their availability.This course prepares graduates for communication, facilitation, international relations, leadership and/or Equality Equity Diversity and Inclusion (EEDI) roles in Creative Industries, Media and Publishing, Consultancy, Education, Government Agencies, Public Administration, Environmental and CleanTech Products and Services, Human Resources, Management and Business Administration, and Services.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "This long-established course is aimed at teachers of second and foreign languages. The discipline of applied linguistics investigates a range of issues around language in contemporary society. Among these, the most prominent issues – and the central topics of the M.Phil. in Applied Linguistics – are those surrounding second and foreign language education. It is often said that globalisation has made the learning of additional languages an essential goal in education, but in truth, language learning has been important in most places at most times. In spite of this, language education in its various aspects was under-researched until the 1960s, so that applied linguistics is a relatively young, but increasingly important field.There are two central strands in the applied linguistics of language teaching and learning. One, usually called second language acquisition, investigates the psychology of language learning, which is a phenomenon that is not confined to the classroom or other instructed contexts. The other, second language pedagogy, focuses on instruction at various different scales: language education policy, curriculum, teaching methods, and learning tasks. Given this educational focus, applied linguistics draws not only on linguistics, but also on educational psychology, educational philosophy, social psychology, and cognitive psychology, among other disciplines.Students need not have any background in linguistics or applied linguistics. They are normally expected to have language teaching experience. Indeed, many of our students have been practising teachers who wish to expand their career horizons by deeper study of the current state of the art in language education. In particular, CLCS has from the start been closely involved with the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and the associated European Language Portfolio, and the rationale for and practical use of these increasingly important tools are a recurring theme in the course. Graduates from this programme have followed various career paths in language education and other language professions, in a variety of roles such as linguistics researcher, interpreter, business consultant and language program manager. Many have opted to pursue research at a higher level through the Ph.D., here in CLCS or elsewhere. For some, Ph.D. research has led to professional academic employment.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "This programme is for students with a strong interest in the social world and who wish to learn how to effectively apply cutting-edge quantitative methods to solve real-world political, economic, and social problems.The Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Social Data Science is a one-year, full-time programme which introduces students to fundamentals in quantitative social science research methods and state-of-the-art analytic approaches from the fields of statistics and machine learning. Graduates of the course will acquire a rich repertoire of social scientific research design skills---grounded in the scientific method---and data analytic methods that are widely sought after in the private, public, and non-profit sectors.The programme is based in Ireland’s highest ranked Department of Political Science. Our department enjoys a strong reputation internationally for its staff who rely on quantitative research methods, and who are well published in leading peer-reviewed academic journals. Staff research agendas include core skills offered in the Applied Social Data Science programme, including computer programming, statistical modeling, machine learning, quantitative text analysis and forecasting.The one year programme covers a wide range of core modules which will help you expand your quantitative research methods toolkit.Please visit the section for more details - https://www.tcd.ie/Political_Science/programmes/postgraduate/pg-dip-applied-social-data-science/course-content/ All modules are taught around a weekly seminar with tutorial sessions and assessed with a mix of homework, exams, and research papers. Students are expected to bring their own laptop (Mac/Windows/Linux) for use in seminars and tutorials throughout the course; note - tablets are not suitable. For minimum laptop specs, please see this helpful guide.The Applied Social Data Science postgraduate diploma award from Trinity is expected to provide you with a competitive edge in the rapidly expanding job market for data scientists:A data analytics degree is proving to be an invaluable asset for today’s labour market. Figures from Indeed, an online job site, suggest that the number of job postings for holders of a data science (or equivalent) degree has increased over 344% since January 2013, with a 29% growth rate year over year. Dice, another online job site, claims a 35% year over year growth rate and has labeled data science as a “high-demand skill”. There is general agreement that there is high demand for data scientists, and crucially, demand outstrips supply. For example, in August 2018, LinkedIn reported that there’s a shortage of 151,717 people with data science skills in the U.S. The average salary for a data scientist in the US has been estimated at 106,000 USD by Dice.A unique trait of the Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Social Data Science programme is that it combines rigorous training in methods from computer science and statistics with social science research skills. There is high demand for social scientists who can apply machine learning and statistical methods for data-driven solutions to challenges faced by governments, political groups, and civil society organizations. For instance, political organizations seek employees who can use computational approaches to analyze large-scale digitized collections of political communication, including social media feeds of elected officials, transcripts of parliamentary debates, and government agency press releases. Government agencies seek employees with experience in applying statistical forecasting methods to predict international conflict, terrorism, and disease outbreaks. Non-profit organizations are keen to hire people who are able to apply machine learning and natural language processing methods to help create data-driven solutions for disabled people. These are just a few examples of the jobs our graduates can pursue with the knowledge that they will have gained from the programme.For non-EU students, it is possible to stay and work in Ireland following course completion using a Stamp 1G visa; see the Trinity Careers Service and the Department of Justice and Equality site for details.Please note that there are two ways of applying for the Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Social Data Science.Applicants are requested to apply through one system or the other, applications cannot be considered through both systems.The Department is not in a position to offer scholarships/fee waivers to incoming students; we recommend investigating funding/scholarship options before making an application e.g:It may also be possible to claim tax relief on tuition fees, see the Revenue site for details.Enquiries can be made to the HCI and Postgraduate Programmes Coordinator or the Course Director of the Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Social Data Science, Dr Constantine Boussalis.

        "Overview": "ADOS-2 is a semi-structured, standardised assessment of communication, social interaction, play/imaginative use of materials and restricted and repetitive behaviours for individuals who have been referred because of possible autism spectrum disorder (ASD).Fundamentally new to the ADOS-2 than ADOS-G are the procedures involved in the algorithm computation and the Comparison Score for module 1 through 3 which were revised on the basis of the findings of recent validation research. The new comparison score provides a way of indicating a participant’s level of autism spectrum related symptomatology and it can also be used to interpret an individual’s own change in autism spectrum related symptoms over time.ADOS-2 also includes a toddler module, which is designed for very young children who do not use phrase speech but who are between the ages of twelve and thirty months. The toddler module has its own algorithms that provide ‘ranges of concern’ instead of cut-off scores.A variety of specialists will use the ADOS-2, their use of results in writing reports and making recommendations to inform medical diagnoses, special education classification and occupational therapists and speech and hearing professionals might use for treatment planning.Training in the ADOS-2 is now available online for use in the clinical setting through the Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin. The training is aimed at professionals with a mental health background who have some familiarity with the tool and it focused on teaching correct administration of the instrument.The online course is structured around 3 components:1. A pre-course self-directed component (approx 4 hours self directed learning);2. A live online course over two days (2 x 5.5 hours) on ADOS Module 1-4 administration;3. A post-course assignment.ADOS-2 Toddler Module will be available as a post-course optional online learning module. The access to this Module will be granted after successfully completed training in Modules 1-4 and post-course assignment that assesses their reliability.Lecturer: Prof. Louise Gallagher.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Biochemistry for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Biochemistry as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Biochemistry is the study of the structure and function of the building blocks of life. Biochemists seek to provide mechanistic explanations for biological processes and ask questions about how things work, why they work and what happens when they don’t! Biochemists have developed many of the key technologies used widely in biomedical sciences. Pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in biochemistry to develop new drugs for many pathological conditions. If you are interested in chemistry or biology then biochemistry is a good choice for you. Biochemistry has a very strong medical slant at Trinity and is an ideal choice if you are interested in biomedical sciences. Biochemistry is also a broad and practical discipline and provides training suitable for many career paths. So if your interests are broadly in the molecular side of the life sciences and medicine but are undecided about your exact career path then biochemistry is good choice for you.When you study biochemistry at Trinity you will have the opportunity to learn from leading researchers in cancer biology, obesity, diabetes, neurobiology, neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, immunometabolism, parasitology, protein structure and drug development. Teaching and training takes place in a new state-of-the-art facility, the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, which allows interdisciplinary training in biomedical sciences. Special features of biochemistry teaching at Trinity is the use of small group (2-3 students) tutorials with an assigned member of staff in third and fourth year, a nine week individual Capstone research project in the laboratory of one of the fifteen principal investigators in biochemistry in your final year and hands on training within the most advanced core facilities for microscopy, cytometry, NMR and X-ray crystallography in the country.This degree will equip you to work in all major aspects of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology. Currently biochemistry graduates work in hospitals, commercial laboratories dealing with analysis, biotechnology, food science, pharmaceuticals or diagnostics. Biochemistry graduates also benefit from their training in critical thinking, analytical reasoning and presentation and communication skills. Consequently, our recent graduates are in high demand in careers not related directly to biochemistry such as communication, information systems, teaching, management, patent law and journalism. Examples of companies where biochemistry graduates from Trinity are employed include Abbot, Andor Technology, Kerry Group, MSD, Novartis, and Pfizer. In addition, recent graduates also work in organisations such as the HSE, HPRA, Forensic Science Ireland, Teagasc and also in science journalism in RTÉ, BBC, Nature group. Biochemistry graduates are also employed in scientific administration in organisations such as the HRB, the Wellcome Trust and the European Commission. Many graduates are also employed in teaching at second and third level.During the first two years, students intending to take Biochemistry as their final degree will take a range of modules in biology, chemistry, mathematics as well as approved modules in other relevant areas.You will study topics including protein structure and function, membrane and cell biology, nucleic acids and research skills. You carry out individual and group project work in 3rd year and there is an emphasis on developing your science communication skills. You also have an opportunity to study complementary modules in other areas of Biology and you can take Trinity Elective modules in non-science subjects.In 4th year you study advanced modules in biochemistry that draw directly from the research ongoing in the school including in the areas of neurobiology, parasitology, cancer biology and metabolic diseases. You will also undertake an individual capstone research project, where you work alongside a Trinity Professor in his/her research laboratory. Some typical recent research projects have looked at the role of inflammation in the progression of breast cancer and the mechanisms that underly chronic neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury.Click here for further information on modules/subject.The School of Biochemistry and Immunology participates in the Erasmus scheme which offers the opportunity for students to spend their third year studying in a partner university.

        "Overview": "Biology is the study of living things; we explore how life first arose: the properties that distinguish living organisms from inert matter; how the vast diversity of life forms was generated; how organisms reproduce themselves; how they interact both with each other and with the environment. Biology is fundamental to understanding the world we live in and plays a huge role in medicine.Modern biological science is unravelling the mysteries of life; it is helping us to meet the challenge of illnesses such as dementia and cancer, to defend against new viruses and drug- resistant bacteria, and to protect ecosystems from climate change and other threats.In this stream, students will study the core concepts that are fundamental to all biological systems. These will be presented in core modules during the first and second year and will include: cell structure and composition, genetics and evolution, molecular biology, metabolism, anatomy and physiology of bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, ecosystems and environmental biology. In addition, students will also acquire mathematical, statistical and computational skills and study the history, philosophy and ethics of science. Students have the opportunity to expand their scientific knowledge and to pursue their individual interests by choosing from a variety of open modules including topics such as animal behaviour, genomes and disease, microbes and immunity, chemistry for biologists and geochemistry.In the third year, students specialise in one of the 11 moderatorships offered in this stream: Biochemistry; Botany; Environmental Science; Genetics; Human Genetics; Immunology; Microbiology; Molecular Medicine; Neuroscience; Physiology; Zoology. The fundamental concepts of each discipline will be presented in core modules while students will also select from a variety of modules from allied disciplines that enhance understanding of their chosen discipline and encourage interdisciplinary thinking and research. Students can also experience the wide range of knowledge and investigation available throughout the university by choosing from a range of Trinity’s electives. In the fourth year students pick from a selection of modules on advanced topics within their discipline. They will also undertake a research project in Trinity or in a research laboratory in another university, research institute or hospital. Throughout this program, students will also acquire skills in problem solving and data handling and in oral and written communication. Click here for further information on modules/subject.This science education programme is designed to foster and develop a student’s capability for independent thought and effective communication, an ability to continue their education independently and to act in a responsible manner. These attributes are a preparation for a career in science and medicine (e.g. in research, biotechnology, pharmaceutical industry); for a career in related areas where a scientific education is beneficial (e.g. patent law, forensic science) and for careers in areas such as education, management, business, industry, communication and policy making.",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study biomedical engineering apply to the engineering degree (TR032). The first two years are common to all engineering students and at the end of the second year students select biomedical engineering as their specialist area.Biomedical engineering is at the intersection of engineering, the life sciences and healthcare. Biomedical engineers take principles from applied science (including mechanical, electrical, chemical and computer engineering) and physical sciences (including physics, chemistry and mathematics) and apply them to biology and medicine. Although the human body is a more complex system than even the most sophisticated machine, many of the same concepts that go into building and programming a machine can be applied to biological structures and systems leading to new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The goal is to better understand, replace or fix a target system to ultimately improve the quality of healthcare.Biomedical engineers become involved in research and development, spanning a broad array of subfields: biofabrication, bioprinting, biomechanics, biomaterials, tissue engineering, neural engineering, medical devices, clinical engineering, medical imaging. Prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses, various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants, advanced imaging methods such as MRIs and EEGs as well as development of regenerative materials, engineered tissues and artificial organs.Biomedical engineering is a challenging professional discipline, requiring knowledge of biology and medicine, as well as understanding of a range of engineering subjects. It is also a very exciting field in which new methods and products are constantly being developed, using the latest technology in materials, mechanics, electronics, mathematical analytical methods and manufacturing processes.Do you enjoy…Biomedical engineering is the fastest-growing career and this trend is expected to continue over the next decade. Ireland’s medical technology sector has evolved into a global leader for medical device and diagnostic products, with exports annually exceeding €12bn. Ireland has over 450 companies involved in developing, manufacturing and marketing medical devices. These include Abbott, Bayer, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson, Guidant, Medtronic and Stryker. These companies have a strong demand for high quality graduates at the master’s and Ph.D. level because of the high technical level of their products.Biomedical engineers also find employment in clinics and hospitals where they work as clinical engineers, responsible for complex, expensive diagnostic equipment and laboratories.Course topics include areas of mechanical, manufacturing, and electronic engineering, specialised topics in biomedical engineering and courses in basic medical and biological sciences. Example biomedical courses include:Biomechanics, Biomaterials, Anatomy and Physiology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Device Design, Tissue Engineering, Neural Engineering, Medical ImagingIn the third year you will study technical courses in both mechanical/manufacturing engineering and electronic engineering, along with courses in anatomy and physiology. In the fourth year and (optional) master’s (fifth) year you will study a range of technical subjects, including the specialised subject of biomedical engineering (see above).Project work is an important aspect of this degree and there is an extensive research facility available to students. You will carry out several projects, including a major Capstone research project in your final year. Examples of final-year projects include: ",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Botany for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Botany as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Botany is the scientific study of plants. These studies are pursued in the field, in the botanic garden and in laboratories. Plants range from the largest forest trees to single celled algae of fresh and marine waters. The study of plants is of vital importance; they are the source of the food we eat, the oxygen we breathe, most of the medicines we use, and are core to the understanding of the processes of global climate change. Dealing with the threats from global climate change will be one of the biggest challenges of this century. Human manipulation of plants in the future will need to provide food and energy for an expanding human population, whilst conserving the biodiversity of living organisms and integrity of habitats.If you are interested in the future of the planet and life on it then Botany is for you. Almost no other course offers you the opportunity to study the natural, living World in the field and laboratory. Our graduates enter into a large range of careers and, as there is a global shortage of plant scientists find employment in a huge range of careers.Trinity’s Botany course is unique in content in Ireland and uncommon in a European context. Uniquely, we integrate small-group teaching, field-based activities and the laboratory. Field-based teaching in ecology, physiology and plant evolution is at its heart: We consider both the whole plant and how it works in a natural context. All staff are research active with high profile, strong research interests in Ireland and the tropics. Consistently, our graduates have rated our course very highly indeed: we believe that our course offers you the best possible training in Ireland for your future career.When you graduate you can move directly into a career related to plant biology, such as nature conservation, environmental consultancy, environmental protection, plant evolutionary biology or agricultural research as well as teaching at second level.

        "Overview": "The business aspects of this degree will result in a graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to work in, understand, and critically evaluate practices within markets, organisations and business management. The study of Business is the study of the integration of a range of fundamental practices of business including finance, marketing, leadership, strategy, accounting, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, and broad management skills designed to explore and enhance our understanding of how companies and industries operate and flourish. You will enjoy this course if you have a core interest in business but would also like to develop and engage with either computer science or law. The business aspects of the programme will provide you with a depth of engagement and understanding of the various aspects of markets, organisations and business management.If you are thinking of Business and Computer Science then you will have an affinity with Computer science subjects and would like to focus on problem solving, using logical and mathematical skills and you will also engage with the management and the business subjects which will help you action these in the commercial world. Computer Science at Trinity is challenging and exciting with a focus on innovation and cutting-edge technology. To get the best from the course you need to be interested in developing clear logical ideas about situations and about how to develop feasible schemes (‘algorithms’) for computers to deal with these situations. You should be comfortable using mathematical techniques to solve problems. If you are knowledgeable about computers already, to the extent of building them or writing programs for them, so much the better – but bear in mind, no prior knowledge of computer science is assumed.If you are thinking of Business and Law then you will have an affinity with Law subjects and would like to focus to gain an in-depth understanding in the disciplines of law and business and to develop a critical understanding of both the legal framework of business activity and the economic and commercial context in which law operates. You will have the opportunity to focus upon the many areas of overlapping interest between the two disciplines, for example, the structure of companies and other forms of business organisation, competition law and regulation of markets, consumer law, labour law, finance and financial markets, taxation, the protection of intellectual property and international perspectives on law and business. This course is aimed at individuals seeking a career defined by the application of legal principles and management practices. The programme will provide you with a firm grounding in law along with strong management skills; enabling students to choose from a wide range of career opportunities or further study.Students taking this joint honours programme are prepared for challenging careers in computer science and/or business, as well as positioning them for postgraduate study and research in either of these fields.

        "Overview": "B.E.S.S. is a uniquely flexible degree programme offering you different degree options across the disciplines of Business, Economics, Political Science and Sociology. It provides students with a broad education and you specialise and graduate with a Single Honours or Joint Honours degree with another subject, or a Major with a Minor. It also offers a high level of flexibility in two very important ways: from the second year onwards students are allowed to (a) choose the specific degree they wish to take and, (b) choose individual modules within their chosen degree path. Students, therefore, have an opportunity to adjust their study programmes in accordance with their academic results, interests, aptitudes and emerging career aspirations.The disciplines of Business, Economics, Political Science and Sociology all examine the world around us, analysing how it works and asking the big questions.Where they differ is in the things they look at and the way they examine them. In your first year as a B.E.S.S. student, you will be introduced to each discipline’s unique but complimentary approach to studying the complex world that we live in. From the second year onwards, the flexible programme structure allows you to choose the disciplines that appeal to you, along with the specific topics that interest you, through a wide range of modules within each discipline. Graduates invariably tell us that it is this broad, flexible approach that allowed them to build the knowledge and insights that they rely on progressively as they advance to more senior positions in their careers.BESS is jointly delivered by the Trinity Business School and the School of Social Sciences and Philosophy:Top international professors and leading business people engage with the students, challenge them and guide them into top roles within the business world. Past students are now leaders in the world of business, government, entertainment, technology, innovation and non-profit businesses.Many of the economic problems which dominate the headlines are explored within this discipline. Economics blends together theory, data and statistical techniques to help understand economic problems and to make policy recommendations.Trinity is ranked 1st in Ireland and 101st in the world (QS World University Rankings, 2021). The Economics Department is ranked joint first In Ireland, in the top 50 in Europe and in the top 150 in the world for Economics and Econometrics (QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2020).Politics affects us all in our daily lives. Should government tax the rich for greater equality? Should the amount of money the EU spends on agriculture be cut? Questions such as these, along with analysis of political systems and how democracy works, are at the heart of the study of politics.Sociology is the study of social change and the consequences of human behaviour. When you study Sociology you will get the opportunity to analyse people and societies, exploring areas as diverse as migration, race and gender, conflict studies, digitalisation, identities and employment studies.Trinity is ranked 1st in Ireland and the Sociology Department is ranked 1st in Ireland and in the top 150 in the world (QS World Rankings By Subject, 2020).From a career perspective B.E.S.S. is an extremely flexible and practical degree programme. Graduates are also highly sought after by employers in a range of fields, such as in finance and banking, politics, research, management consulting, teaching, public service, journalism, within both national and international organisations within the profit, not for profit and public sector. Graduates have gone on to successful and rewarding careers in varied roles around the globe. The following are just a few examples of the organisations that have recruited B.E.S.S. graduates: Accenture, Alcatel, Cisco, Barclay’s Bank, Commission for Energy Regulation, Enterprise Ireland, Google, KPMG, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, Tesco, Topshop, Channel 4 and Atlantic Philanthropies.In the first year you will take all four subjects: business, economics, political science and sociologyIn second year you can choose to continue with one, two or three subjects and could, for example, take modules ranging from Intermediate Economics to International Politics, to an Introduction to Social Theory and modules from a list of available Trinity Electives or complementary/open modulesIn third year, following on from your second year, yyou choose your degree pathway and pursue either two or one of the four subjects, and if applicable, choose complementary open modules. In the fourth year you may choose to take one or two subject and can exit with a Single Honours, Major with Minor or Joint Honours award. All students will complete a capstone project in their final year.Third and fourth year enter your degree at 30% to 70% respectively.Current module descriptors for all four years of the programme can be found on the BESS website: www.tcd.ie/bess.In second year, Single Honours students, as well as taking modules from their preferred discipline, also select modules from one or more of the other three disciplines. In third and fourth years, students take the majority of their modules from their chosen discipline but, in keeping with the B.E.S.S. philosophy of flexibility, there is significant scope to choose modules which appeal most from the range of available modules.Throughout third and fourth year, Joint Honours students take approximately half of their modules from each of the two disciplines. Major with Minor students have more modules in their major discipline throughout third and fourth year. Since module choices may be made from among the full range available in two disciplines, the Joint Honours and Major with Minor degree routes offer exceptionally high flexibility with regard to programme design and module choice.Most B.E.S.S. modules involve a system of continuous assessment, essays, projects and/or presentations contributing between 30% to 50% of the overall grade per module. The remainder is based on the results of a written end-of-semester examination. Module Descriptors for all four years of the programme can be accessed via the Course Handbook www.tcd.ie/ssp/undergraduate/bess/current/handbookThere are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.First and second year B.E.S.S. students have the option to study Irish, French, German, Spanish, Russian or Polish. Students also have the opportunity to study abroad in their third year at leading universities in countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium or Spain, as well as English-speaking international exchange programmes to prestigious universities in Europe, North America, Australia and Asia (China, Hong Kong and Japan). Some of the more popular universities are Uppsala University, Sweden; Emory University, Georgia, Senshu University, Japan; IEP – Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris, France; QUT Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia and the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.",

        "Overview": "Chemistry is a creative and central science, dealing with challenges that span the physical and life sciences. It is found and used everywhere from the creation of new materials and processes through to advancements in medical health and diagnosis of disease.A chemistry-based qualification provides students with the relevant skills and knowledge to open doors in research, medicine, education, industry, finance, consultancy and more.As well as practical knowledge of the subject, chemistry students develop many other transferable skills that are valued by both employers and the wider community. These range from critical thinking and problem-solving to communication and creativity. Nobody knows what the jobs of the future will look like, but chemists will be needed to tackle problems in human health, sustainable energy, technology, food management and the environment. Academics at the School of Chemistry are at the forefront of cutting-edge research and are contributing to ground-breaking advances that benefit society. These include nanotechnology, drug-delivery, energy storage and computational modelling.In the Chemical Sciences Stream students will study the core concepts that are fundamental to all of chemistry including topics in physical, organic and inorganic chemistry. Students will receive a strong grounding in mathematics and will be able to expand their scientific knowledge and to pursue their individual interests by choosing from a cohort of approved and elective modules on topics such as physics, chemical biology, and history and philosophy of science. In the third year, students specialise in one of the five moderatorships offered in this stream: Chemistry, Chemistry with Biosciences, Chemistry with Molecular Modelling, Medicinal Chemistry and Nanoscience (the physics and chemistry of advanced materials). Small group teaching from academic experts who are actively researching in these subjects creates an exciting teaching and research-led environment where current state-of-the-art research is discussed together with fundamental concepts.Students can also experience the wide range of knowledge and investigation available throughout the university by choosing an elective module from a selection that highlights major research themes from across all faculties. In the fourth year students choose from a selection of modules on advanced topics within their discipline. They will also undertake a Capstone research project in Trinity or in a research laboratory in another university, research institute or industry partner.This offers students the opportunity to gain international experience, giving them the choice to pursue their final year Capstone research project abroad.

        "Overview": "This postgraduate degree programme offers an exciting opportunity to study a wide range of children's literature – a broad category that encompasses everything from picture books through to Young Adult fiction. Examining texts from across several centuries, the course addresses chronologies, genres, modes of criticism, readerships, publishing trends and the full apparatus of literary investigation, while exploring the unique power dynamics that arise from adult authors creating texts for younger readers. While the focus is on literary analysis, the programme also currently offers a creative writing element. The course may be taken full-time or part-time.Situated in Dublin, a UNESCO City of Literature, this taught master’s programme also pays special attention to the role of the Irish contribution to the development of children's literature in English. It offers unique opportunities to engage in archival research, to explore the Pollard Collection of Children’s Books – the largest collection of children’s books in Ireland – as well as to work with the National Collection of Children’s Books (nccb.tcd.ie).The course consists a core module ‘Perspectives and Case Studies in Children’s Literature’ that runs in the first and the second semester, as well as option modules. Students take one option module in each of the semesters, choosing from a variety of special subjects on offer each year. In recent years, the children’s literature options have included: ‘The Victorian Child’, ‘The City and Children’s Literature’, ‘Material Culture and Children’s Literature’, and ‘Creative Writing for Children’. Students also take the one-semester modules ‘Research Skills for Postgraduate English’ and ‘Mapping the Literary Field’, which are shared with other M.Phil. programmes at the School of English. There are also opportunities to take an option module outside of the area of children’s literature. Students finally complete a dissertation of 15,000 –16,000 words.Students of different nationalities and from diverse backgrounds and disciplines have successfully completed the programme since it was established in 2011. Many graduates have careers in areas such as editing, publishing, arts management, journalism, curation, teaching, librarianship, and academia. Over the years, students have worked with leading academics in the field, attended guest lectures by local and international scholars and authors, applied for funding opportunities to research archives at Yale University and at Trinity, collaborated with Children’s Books Ireland on their ‘Bold Girls’ initiative, curated an exhibition in Trinity Library’s Long Room (see Story Spinners: Irish Women and Children’s Books), created podcasts with International Literature Festival Dublin, and immersed themselves in the vibrant children’s literature community at the School of English.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Waste management, scarcity of resources, minimizing emissions and energy use while maximizing selective reuse and recycling processes are some of the issues that need to be considered to allow for future economic growth, reduction of negative environmental impacts and to tackle climate disruption.The Circular Economy concept offers strong alternative solutions to these problems. The main goal of this approach is to keep products, components, and materials at their highest levels of use and value by closing the loop of product life cycles. This approach requires allowing economic activity to grow while minimizing the use of finite resources and waste generation.The circular model is based on three principles:• Designing out waste and pollution• Keeping products and materials in use• Regenerating natural systemsThis course will provide students with core knowledge of the Circular Economy concept as well as the relevant technologies used in the recycling area. Through a blended delivery of modules, this programme will explore topics such as life cycle assessment (LCA), waste management, waste rock reclamation, waters, and sludge treatment as well as recycling, reprocessing, and remanufacturing. It will allow students to develop a unique perspective of the design process to enable the recovery and reuse of materials.Course Modules Introduction to Circular Economy and Materials ScienceIntroduction to Energy EconomicsPlastics, Composites and Plastics Recycling Fundamentals of plasticsWaste Management and Energy RecoverySustainable Materials and Environmental ManagementRaw Materials Management and RecyclingEngineering for the EnvironmentLife cycle assessment (LCA)Supervised Research ProjectTeaching will be provided by a multidisciplinary team of experts across the Schools of Chemistry, Physics, Engineering and Natural Sciences, all of whom are active researchers in this cutting-edge area. This course also includes a research project that will be supervised by one of our academic experts across the Schools of Chemistry, Engineering, Physics and Natural Sciences.This is one of the first programmes of its kind internationally and is distinctive in its structure, offering students a unique opportunity to combine knowledge and research expertise in the area.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Programme Details The next intake for this course is in September 2022 and will finish in August 2023.Assessment The taught modules on this course are examined through a combination of continuous assessment and final examinations.Graduates of this programme will be uniquely placed to work in a wide range of sectors such as manufacturing, environmental and recycling industries. Graduates will provide significant expertise and added value to companies, and support growth and competitiveness across relevant Irish and European industries.For those interested in pursuing academic research, the School hosts many internationally recognised academics in research. Graduates will also be eligible to pursue further study in other universities where research in this and related fields is carried out.Trinity provides a distinctive education based on academic excellence and a transformative student experience that encourages students to be active participants in their learning. Through this programme, students will develop a unique range of knowledge, skills and attributes that will enhance their employability and prepare them for their future career journey.Working in Ireland Under the Third Level Graduate Scheme, the Irish Government allows non-EU/EEA students to seek employment in Ireland for 24 months after completing their postgraduate study.",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study civil, structural and environmental engineering apply to the engineering degree (TR032).The first two years are common to all engineering students and at the end of the second-year students select civil, structural and environmental engineering as their specialist area.Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering is a very diverse and broad discipline. It offers graduates the chance to work on projects that improve people’s lives. These include the design of better transport systems, looking after the environment, constructing new buildings and bridges and creating the infrastructure on which society depends. Civil engineers are responsible for running many of the world’s largest businesses and public agencies. The skills needed to be a good civil engineer are a logical and systematic approach, good problem-solving and creative abilities, backed up by a mathematical and scientific mind. In addition to these skills a civil engineer needs to be imaginative and inquisitive.Civil engineers are responsible for the planning, design, and operation of our cities and infrastructure. These include user-centred and integrated transport systems and renewable and sustainable energy systems, as well as a myriad of support systems located underground.Structural engineering involves the design and construction of many types of structure, including buildings, bridges, stadiums, and wind turbines. Structural engineers ensure that a building is safe for the area in which it is built and for its intended purpose. It must also be attractive, economical and have a minimum impact on the environment.Environmental engineers design the systems that provide us with clean water, manage our waste and deal with pollution in air, land or water. Environmental engineers also optimise our use of energy and natural resources, minimise industrial Impacts on people and nature, and ensure that development happens in a sustainable wayMost civil engineering graduates start their careers with engineering consultants working in infrastructure and building design, energy, environmental protection and transport management (e.g. Arup, Atkins, Jacobs) and construction companies (e.g. BAM, Sisk). Civil engineers are also often employed in financial services, management consultancy, law firms and in corporate business. The numerical and problem-solving skills and technical expertise of civil engineers are broad based and make them very attractive employees in many different industries.In third, fourth and M.A.I. (fifth) years, students are offered modules in Structural and Geotechnical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Transportation and Sustainable Energy. More information can be found at: www.tcd.ie/engineering/current-studentsA significant amount of teaching takes place in the laboratory, and the course involves a lot of project work. In third year, students undertake site visits to civil engineering projects, iconic engineering structures and to areas of environmental interest. This includes a one-week technical visit to an international location. Recent trips have included visits to London and Barcelona.In the third and fourth year projects, students work in small groups to design a building or piece of major infrastructure. There is also the opportunity to undertake an internship in industry or with a research group or to participate in the Unitech, Cluster or Erasmus exchange programmes.The optional fifth year allows students to study toward the master’s degree qualification at a more advanced level, including an individual Capstone research project and thesis.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

Through the examination and contextualisation of literary works and the analysis of the main aspects of ancient history and art, you will develop a thorough knowledge of the classical world and a critical approach to Greek and Roman literature. All texts are studied in translation and no knowledge of Greek or Latin is required, but there are opportunities to study the languages at an introductory level.Do you enjoy:If you enjoy literature; if you want to acquire an understanding of the past and its influence; if you would like to engage with the mythology, poetic imagination, depth of thought and historical value of two civilisations that shaped the western world, this may be the course for you.The Department of Classics has a world renowned reputation and courses are taught by academics at the top of their fields. Classical Civilisation offers you the opportunity to learn about the ancient world in a fun and friendly environment and learn not only about the past but also about its significance to the present. There are opportunities to participate in study tours and summer schools to classical sites for both credit and non-credit. The course is taught through a mixture of lectures and small-group seminars, which encourage lively discussion and the development of independent thinking. It is also possible to study abroad for a semester or a whole year.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours. It is also possible to take this subject up as a New Minor Subject from second year, please see page 28 for further information.Business, librarianship, museum work, publishing, teaching and theatre are some of the many fields recent graduates have entered. Recent graduates are working for companies as diverse as Smurfit Communications, Blackwell Publishing and the Gare St. Lazare Players. Students who opted to undertake further study have selected courses ranging from law and marketing to teacher training and international peace studies.Over the four years you will develop a broad understanding of the classical world, primarily through its literature. You will move from introductory modules in history and literature and art in the first year to the study of specific authors, genres and themes in the second and third years. In your final year you will choose from a range of specialised options. All modules are taught by lectures and small-group seminars. A range of different assessment types (e.g., end-of-semester examinations, essays, seminar presentations and team projects, artefact studies and short commentaries on texts) is used to assess your progress, and a thesis is written in the final year.In first year you will be introduced to the critical study of ancient history, literature, myth and religion, with a view to acquiring a comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on classical culture.

        "Overview": "Classics, Ancient History and Archaeology (CLAHA) is an integrated degree programme that allows you to study the history, literature, art, archaeology, culture and thought of the ancient world in conjunction with one or both of the ancient languages. Flexible pathways enable you to pursue your own interests and graduate with a Single Honours degree in Classics (Latin and Greek), Ancient History and Archaeology, or Classical Civilisation, or to choose from a wide range of Joint Honours and Major/Minor combinations. Both languages can be begun from scratch, and previous study is not necessary.This may be the course for you if you enjoy learning languages, and are interested in studying the history, literature and culture of ancient civilisations, their achievements and their profound influence on the modern world. Whether you are more attracted by the mythology, literature and thought of the ancient world, or by the study of its material remains and the historical record of its achievements, CLAHA will allow you to develop and pursue your own interests and shape the degree programme in the way that suits you best.The Department of Classics has a world renowned reputation and courses are taught by academics at the top of their fields. Classics has been taught in Trinity since its foundation just over 400 years ago, and Trinity is unique in having professorships in both Greek and Latin. Teaching formats include a mixture of lectures, practical classes and small-group seminars, which encourage lively discussion and the development of independent thinking. There are opportunities to participate in archaeological fieldwork and in organised study tours to Greece and Italy, for both credit and non-credit. It is also possible to study abroad for a semester or a whole year.Trinity has a long tradition of Classics graduates who have continued on to postgraduate study and successful academic careers both in Europe and America. Our students find that their degree has been a real education and a source of continuing satisfaction to them, whatever employment they take up after leaving us. Recent graduates of the Classics Department have pursued careers in business, journalism, public relations, heritage and museum work, publishing, teaching and theatre, and are working for companies ranging from McKinsey and Co. and the Sunday Independent to the Gare St. Lazare Players.At the beginning of the degree programme, you will be asked to choose between a dual language pathway (typically leading to a degree in Classics) and a single language pathway (typically leading to a degree in Ancient History and Archaeology or Classical Civilisation, with the option of continuing with the language to degree level). It is possible to switch between pathways in second year.All students study all of the three subjects below and take a common core, consisting of introductory modules in Greek and Roman History and Art and Architecture. Students following the single language pathway take further modules in: Reading and Writing about Ancient Literature, Sources and Methods for Ancient History and Archaeology, language-based modules at either Beginners’ or Intermediate level, depending on whether you have studied the language before. Students following the dual language pathway take modules in both Greek and Latin at Beginners’ or Intermediate level, as appropriate; if beginning both languages from scratch, they follow the single language pathway in first year and begin the second language in second year:In your second year, you will be asked to confirm your choice of pathway, and will have the opportunity to focus on the aspects of the programme that most interest you. Students following the single language pathway choose a preponderance of modules in Ancient History and Archaeology or Classical Civilisation in accordance with their preferred degree outcome (Single or Joint Honours or Major/Minor). At this stage, you may or may not choose to continue with the language taken in first year; you will also have the option of taking Trinity Elective modules or Approved Modules from another programme.Students following the dual language pathway will continue to study both languages at Beginners or Intermediate level, and will take Trinity Elective modules or Open Modules.In third and fourth year, you will continue to specialise in either Ancient History and Archaeology, Classical Civilisation or Classics, according to your preferred degree outcome. All modules are taught through lectures and small-group seminars and will encourage you to discuss key themes of relevance to both the ancient and modern world.Ancient History and Archaeology modules offer the opportunity to focus on specific themes and periods in the history and archaeology of the Mediterranean, develop a deeper awareness of methods and theory, engage with ethical issues concerning cultural heritage,and to do ‘hands on’ work with artefacts. Classical Civilisation modules focus on specific genres (e.g. epic, drama, philosophy, history-writing) or themes (e.g. gender and sexuality, humans and other animals): you will refine your analysis of texts in their context through specialised methodologies. In fourth year you will choose from a range of options, such as Entertainment and Spectacle; Goddesses of the Ancient Mediterranean; Anthropology and the Greeks; Kings and Cities; Constantine; Ancient Novel. Third and fourth year modules in Classics progress to an in-depth study Greek and Roman literature, history and culture. You will refine your analysis of texts in their literary and cultural context through more specialised methodologies. Greek topics may include lyric and Hellenistic poetry, philosophy, and the novel. Latin topics may include Augustan poetry, Senecan tragedy, didactic poetry, early Latin, and satire.Fourth year for all students includes a Capstone project, in the form of a dissertation on a subject of your choice. This is an opportunity to develop independent ideas and acquire critical skills while investigating in greater depth an area that particularly interests you. There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.This degree is also available within the Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University.The Department has valuable Erasmus links with the Universities of Cyprus, Udine (Italy), Geneva, Bordeaux, and Koç (Turkey). Students are also able to avail of University-wide exchanges, for example, to North America and Australia. These opportunities allow students the option of spending a year or part of a year abroad.Two BA Honours Bachelor Degrees (NFQ Level 8) Degrees awarded by Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin and Columbia UniversityThe Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University offers students a unique opportunity to earn two BA degrees while spending the first two years at Trinity and years three and four at Columbia University in New York.This course is for those interested in expanding their experience to gain a truly international education. Students in the Dual BA Programme graduate with two BA degrees, one from Trinity and one from Columbia. After the first two years in Trinity, students then spend a further two years at Columbia, where they fulfil the requirements for one of the approved majors while also completing Columbia’s core curriculum. Students also undertake additional study to meet the requirements of the Trinity BA, including a Capstone project.At Trinity students are introduced to the study of Greek and Roman literature, history, art and architecture through broad-based survey and skills modules and undertake modules in Greek and/or Latin. In the second year, students choose more specialised historical, archaeological, and literary/cultural modules. Flexible pathways enable students to pursue their own interests. At Columbia students choose one of four majors: Classics; Archaeology; Ancient Studies; Classical Studies. Students also undertake a summerschool or a multidisciplinary-taught module.Applicants to the Dual BA Programme must apply by 2nd January 2022 for September 2022 entry. The admissions process includesa review of the applicant’s academic history, letters of recommendation, an essay, and an interview conducted in English. Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) can be submitted but are not required for 2022 entry. Applications are reviewed by a joint committee with representatives from both Institutions. EU applicants to the Dual BA Programme must also apply to and receive an offer from their chosen programme at Trinity through the Central Applications Office (CAO).Further information and contact details:www.tcd.gs.columbia.eduE columbiadualba@tcd.ie ",

        "Overview": "Climate history is a rapidly evolving field of study that aims (1) to reconstruct climate conditions over past centuries and millennia and (2) understand how societies perceived and responded to changing climates and extreme weather. These aims can be best achieved by combining evidence from both natural and human archives. In this module we will examine the historical development of natural archives such as tree-rings and ice-cores and introduce how they can be used to reveal climate variations in the past. We will then examine how this information can be combined with evidence from human archives, including written and archaeological records, to understand the social impacts of climate change and extreme weather. In doing so, we will draw upon case studies of major episodes of climate change from the ancient and medieval eras. These case studies will bring us from ancient Egypt and Babylonia to the ancient American Southwest, and from there to Medieval Ireland, Japan, China and beyond. In these places we will examine the role that explosive volcanic eruptions and rapid changes in the Sun’s output of energy played in causing extreme weather that was often accompanied by major human impacts such as famine, disease and conflict, before studying the ways in which ancient and medieval societies attempted to cope with these impacts and adapt to changing climates.Lecturer: Dr Francis LudlowHow to ApplyPlease check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ in December for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.You may apply online or by *phone as follows: ONLINE: You may register and pay online at http://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses AFTER enrolments openBy telephone: Please text ‘APPLY FOR COURSE’ to 087 257 2015* and you will receive a call back from us.Please note that the phone will be very busy during the application period so there may be a delay in replying to your call.

        "Overview": "Become confident prescribing exercise to clinical populations.The aim of this postgraduate diploma course is to enable clinicians to prescribe exercise as a disease preventative and treatment modality in a safe, effective and scientific manner. Students will achieve this through a tiered process starting with a thorough understanding of the physiology of the cardiovascular and respiratory system and the body’s reactions to different types of physical activity and exercise (module 1). The second module will concentrate on physical activity and exercise at the populations’ level as well as detailing the importance of and various methods used to assess physical activity, body composition, strength and aerobic fitness. The third and fourth modules will be clinically focused and will use case scenarios and current literature to demonstrate how the application of exercise and physical activity can be an effective and safe treatment modality for patients with common chronic morbidities. As this course will be evidence-based, students will become critical consumers of literature in the area of exercise in the prevention and treatment of chronic disease. Module 5 will develop a students’ ability to critically evaluate the latest research in order to keep up to date with the latest clinical advances in the discipline. Module 6 will provide students with a thorough understanding of the relationship between exercise and metabolism. Finally, in module 7 students will gain valuable practical experience on critical techniques used by clinicians in the assessment of cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal fitness.This Postgraduate Diploma can be completed in one or two academic years and will be made up of 60 ECTS. With the exception of the final blended module (Module 7) all other course material will be online with some material presented in real time (synchronous live webinars) and some material recorded/prepared for students to complete in their own time.

        "Overview": "The ability to speak and write, to listen and learn, to be understood – abilities that are fundamental to human communication and interaction – can be impaired by a wide range of conditions, from stroke to cerebral palsy, hearing impairment, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and autism. Speech and Language Therapists work with people of all ages and assess, diagnose and treat individuals with a variety of communication and swallowing disorders. Since communication and swallowing difficulties affect every aspect of a person’s life, the work of the speech and language therapist is multi-faceted, and therapists work in a variety of settings, from schools to hospitals and other clinical settings.This course will appeal to you if you have an interest in how speech, language, communication and swallowing work and how these areas may be affected in either children or adults. You will enjoy this course if you like a variety of teaching, learning and assessment approaches, such as lectures, problem-based and case-based learning and clinical practice.When you decide on a career as an allied healthcare professional, you need to ensure you have the best academic and clinical preparation to succeed. The Department of Clinical Speech and Language Studies is the longest established, accredited undergraduate programme in speech and language therapy in Ireland. The team involved in the delivery of this course enjoy national and international recognition in teaching and research, and are experts in their respective fields. You might be surprised to learn that the knowledge and skills developed while studying Clinical Speech and Language Studies equips graduates to work in a wide range of interesting and challenging contexts.Whilst graduates emerge with an in-depth knowledge of their discipline, they also have important transferable skills that provide a strong foundation to engage with society and the workplace. Graduates develop the ability to think independently, act responsibly, communicate effectively and develop continuously. Graduates are ethically minded, resourceful and are ready to embrace challenges and innovations in their chosen specialty. They become key stakeholders in the development of the speech and language therapy profession in national and international healthcare contexts and in advocating for the rights of people who have communication and swallowing impairments. Graduates from this course are highly sought after and valued by employers in healthcare and educational contexts.The four-year Honours degree course comprises an integrated programme of theory and practice. The key strands within the curriculum are: Speech and Language Pathology and Swallowing Disorders, Clinical Practice, Linguistics, Psychology, Research and Basic Sciences (e.g., Anatomy and Physiology).Much of first year is focused on foundation studies for understanding typical communication and swallowing behaviours. The emphasis in second year is on understanding and assessing the strengths and needs of the client population served by the profession, together with studying speech sciences, psychology and linguistics. Third year places emphasis on the application of this knowledge to intervention in clinical contexts. You will also study neurology, psychiatry, discourse analysis and further develop your research skills. In fourth year, students are provided with the opportunity to integrate knowledge skills and competencies, acquired through the four years. Students prepare to become practitioners and researchers and complete a significant piece of research known as the Capstone project.Clinical activities and placements provide an important learning context from the start of the course. The department has access to a wide range of service settings and clinics, in which to place students, e.g. hospitals, schools, clinics, rehabilitation centres. During term time, an average of one day per week is reserved for clinical work. You will also be required to undertake clinical practice outside term time.Click here for further information on modules/subject.The course employs a wide range of teaching, learning and assessment strategies. Both continuous assessment and end of semester exams are undertakenWhilst the Department of Clinical Speech and Language Studies has a strong international network, the nature of the professional course – in terms of the clinical practice requirements – precludes study abroad at undergraduate level. However, students get an opportunity to engage in international summer schools, in the summer vacation period.

        "Overview": "Computer Science is concerned with the study of everything to do with computers and our relationship with them. Computer scientists are critical to the efficient running of modern societies, dealing with health, security, banking and finance, transportation, and now increasingly our interaction through social networks. Computing professionals deal with theoretical issues, solve complex problems, deal with matters of ethics and with society at large. Theoretical issues in computer science relate to the abstract notions of computation and information.The study of these issues leads, for example, to efficient and robust algorithms for problems in many areas. Applications of computer science range from artificial intelligence to health informatics, from smart cities to information security, and from educational and training systems to analysis of content on social network sites.Computer Science at Trinity is a challenging and exciting course with a focus on innovation and cutting-edge technology. To get the best from the course you need to be interested in developing clear logical ideas about situations and about how to develop feasible schemes (‘algorithms’) for computers to deal with these situations.

In addition, students will make a start on specialist modules in their chosen strand, learning the key techniques of Data Mining & Analysis including classification techniques, neural networks and ensemble methods with practical work in the R language. Additionally, students discover how large data sets might be gathered and manipulated in large cloud computing facilities in the Scalable Computing module.During the second term (January – March), students begin foundational work on their dissertation, and immerse themselves in further specialist modules of their chosen strand. The module on Optimisation Algorithms for Data Analysis will explore topics such as Convex optimisation, large dimension simulation. Applied Statistical Modelling will deal with many popular techniques such as Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulation with an opportunity to apply these techniques to a real data set. Students will learn how to reveal the insights derived from large data sets in the Data Visualisation module and cover essential crypto and security concerns of data in the Security & Privacy module. In addition, you can choose three additional electives (one in Term 1 and two in Term 2) from a pool of modules offered in the other strands of the M.Sc. programme.The summer term (April – August) will be exclusively focused on the Dissertations, doing experimental work, building prototypes and writing up the work. By April, students will have chosen a Dissertation topic, picked and consulted with their chosen supervisor and be ready to devote substantial time to researching and prototyping your work. We expect that the top projects should deliver publishable quality papers over this period. During the year, all projects will be showcased to an industry audience comprising indigenous, small & medium employers and multinational companies.Please note that the course content is updated on an annual basis and some changes occur from year to year. Students accepted on the course will be given formal module descriptors before the start of term. Graduates of this programme have many exciting career opportunities.

        "Overview": "The new M.Sc. in Computer Science has a common set of entry criteria and leads to a Master's degree in Computing, specializing in one of four exciting areas: Data Science, Intelligent Systems, Augmented & Virtual Reality and Future Networked Systems. The course is designed and taught by staff who are leading experts in their fields, and the course content is inspired by their cutting-edge work as well as their contacts with leading industry researchers around the globe. We expect our graduates to be in high demand for high-end research and development positions within leading multi-national companies and start-up companies alike. In some cases our graduates have gone on to take up funded PhD studies at TCD.The Intelligent Systems Strand focuses on smart, interactive web applications and systems, which are becoming an integral part of our daily lives at home, in the workplace, and in social interaction. Designing and building these systems requires expertise in artificial intelligence, human language understanding and generation, web systems and applications, data analytics and knowledge engineering. This strand is closely linked to the school's research groups involved in the ADAPT centre for Digital Content Technology.The marketplace of the future will see intelligent behaviour becoming the standard for computer systems. The courses within the Intelligent Systems strand will provide graduates with the ability to specialise in intelligent adaptive systems and artificial intelligence, providing them with the necessary skills to become leaders in these fields. Employment opportunities exist in a wide range of areas such as internet-based services, financial services, mobile communication companies. Students will also benefit from the comprehensive research scope, networks, and wealth of research achievements in both the School and the ADAPT Centre.The course is taught over a full calendar year, with two 12-week semesters of taught modules, involving attendance at labs and lectures, followed by dedicated research work over the remaining summer months for the MSc Dissertation.In the first term (September - December), all students gain the necessary skills in a number of Core Modules common to the M.Sc. Programme. These include Research Methods (to enable students to produce their own dissertation), Innovation (to equip students with skills in company formation or innovating within a large company) and Machine Learning (a foundational technique for each of the specializations). In addition, students will make a start on specialist modules in their chosen strand. They will gain a grounding in Information Retrieval & Web Search, and examine, in-depth, the theoretical and practical issues involved in searching the web or any or large corpus of documents, including text processing, ranking scores, classification etc. In Knowledge & Data Engineering, they will learn about the semantic web including model design, reasoning and querying. All students take a 10-credit module in Advanced Software Engineering, taught over two terms, which explores the methods and techniques involved in large-scale software development encompassing Agile and eXtreme Programming (XP), Test-driven development and Re-factoring.During the second term (January – March), students begin foundational work on their dissertation, and immerse themselves in further specialist modules of their chosen strand. The term will deal with Artificial Intelligence techniques, including models of human cognitive architectures, knowledge representation techniques such as Ontologies and models of natural language processing. This module is complemented by the Text Analytics module which demonstrates how finite-state methods, model theory and category theory can be used to analyse content and determine sentiment. The Adaptive Applications module is hands-on, exploring how applications can adapt to suit individual users. In addition, students choose three additional electives (one in Term 1 and two in Term 2) from a pool of modules offered in the other strands of the M.Sc. programme.The summer term (April – August) will be exclusively focused on the Dissertations, doing experimental work, building prototypes and writing up the work. By April, students will have chosen a Dissertation topic, picked and consulted with their chosen supervisor and be ready to devote substantial time to researching and prototyping your work. We expect that the top projects should deliver publishable quality papers over this period. During the year, all projects will be showcased to an industry audience comprising indigenous, small & medium employers and multinational companies.Please note that the course content is updated on an annual basis and some changes occur from year to year. Students accepted on the course will be given formal module descriptors before the start of term.

        "Overview": "The Computer Science, Linguistics and a Language (CSLL) degree is an integrated, interdisciplinary programme. CSLL students learn computer science, study linguistics, the scientific study of language and speech, and study a specific language (with a choice of French, Spanish or Irish). There is an emphasis on the intersection of these subjects, on computationaland empirical approaches to language, knowledge of which is important to the ever-growing fields of speech and language technology, such as machine translation, speech synthesis and recognition.All the component disciplines are pursued to a high level, equipping CSLL graduates to pursue a very wide range of careers, such as in computing in general, in roles requiring skills in a particular language and in the speech and language technology area. If you enjoy problem solving, conceptual analysis, mathematics, language learning and are interested in combining topics in creative and insightful ways, then this may be the right course for you. It appeals to students with strengths in analytical reasoning and an affinity for mastering languages, but who do not want to choose between arts and sciences. Project work pursued throughout provides scope for personal expression.This is one of the most integrated, interdisciplinary degrees on offer, bridging computer science, linguistic sciences and the arts. It is the only programme of its kind in Ireland, and unique internationally as an undergraduate degree offering. The teaching is research led: many lecturers are themselves involved in research and the development of speech and language technology. Students get to see and, at times, participate in this research, and graduates are highly sought after as researchers. The interdisciplinary skills acquired open doors to world mobility and employability.Computer Science at Trinity is ranked number 1 in Ireland, top 30 in Europe and top 100 worldwide (QS subject rankings, 2020).Over more than 50 years, it has earned a strong international reputation and has partnerships in education, research and industry across the globe.Since the course began in 1985, graduates have moved on to careers that reflect CSLL’s diversity. Graduates are qualified to work as language specialists, in the language and speech technology sector, as information technologists or software specialists in any of the IT, banking, translation, publishing or multimedia sectors. Some work as software engineers. Some have careers in professional translation; others in education. About 65% of graduates work in software engineering (often language oriented), whether in a mainly English-speaking country, or in a country where the language of the degree focus is the native language. About 25% pursue research careers and a number of graduates now hold academic staff positions in Ireland and abroad. Another 10% move into technical translation. Some are employed in government services, e.g. the European Patent Office and the Irish Diplomatic Corps.In the first two years, you will study computer science, linguistics and your chosen language, exploring areas where computers and the science and practice of language meet. Students complete increasingly complex projects in each year of the programme. The final year offers opportunities for more in-depth interdisciplinary work, or for specialisation in the classical core of the constituent disciplines.First year and Second yearIn first year there is a comprehensive introduction to computers, how to program them and certain fundamentals of how they really work, with no prior knowledge assumed. The second year builds upon this with more advanced programming, a study of fundamental data structures and algorithms and specifically an introduction to computational treatments of language: computational linguistics. Linguistics modules introduce the scientific study of how the sounds, words and syntax of languages are structured and of the processes involved in human communication. These encompass both theoretical and computational elements (such as Speech Science and Phonetics, Computational Morphology). As mathematical tools are on occasion required, in support of this there are also mathematics courses. In CSLL’s third stream, modules from the language departments provide for the detailed study and mastery of the productive and receptive skills of a specific language as well as Area Studies, which typically explores the culture and society of the country/ies of that language.Subject areas includeFirst Year:Computer Science:Linguistics:Language:Second Year:Computer Science:Linguistics:Language:Third and fourth yearsYou study the three streams of CSLL in third and fourth years, either at Trinity or abroad (in 3rd year) under the Erasmus programme. Module choices allow you to personalise to individual strengths. Relating to language, there are advanced modules such as Computational Linguistics (involving Speech Recognition and Machine Translation), Speech Analysis and Synthesis, and Human Second-Language Acquisition. Then of wider relevance there are such modules as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Vision and Computer Graphics. You also proceed to advanced study in your chosen language, perfecting your skills in translation, essay writing and oral presentation. There is a fourth year Capstone project: it may be interdisciplinary, or it may focus on just one of the three contributing streams.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.The programme has Erasmus exchange agreements which allow you to pursue CSLL’s three streams at a university abroad in the third year. Besides excellent technical modules, this gives you a great opportunity to develop language skills and experience life abroad. Students of French or Spanish spend the third year at a university abroad and for students studying Irish this is also a possibility ",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Computer Engineering apply to the Engineering degree (TR032). The first two years are common to all Engineering students and at the end of the second-year students select Computer Engineering as their specialist area.Technology has evolved significantly in the last 20 years and it is no longer so easy to separate the skills of design engineers in Electronic Engineering and Computer Engineering. Therefore Trinity offers three specialties in the area: Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering and Electronic and Computer Engineering. If you are interested in Computer Engineering you should also consider Electronic and Computer Engineering and Electronic Engineering.A computer engineer has mastered the necessary knowledge of mathematics and systems to tackle a whole range of realworld problems. Layered on top of these fundamentals is a set of specialist skills in computing that range from how a computer is designed and constructed to the application of computing power to solve a range of problems from social media to navigation, from medicine to space travel, and many more besides. The impact of computer engineering has been more significant and more pervasive than that of many other disciplines. The smart phone, tablet computers, the Internet and games consoles are all products that were not even imagined 30 years ago, but have now been realised by the ingenuity of computer engineers.Computer engineers may design computer hardware, write computer programs, integrate the various sub-systems together or do all three. They need good people skills as they often get quickly promoted to management positions.The School of Computer Science and Statistics which runs the Computer Engineering programme is the oldest computer science department in Ireland with more than 60 academics and over 300 postgraduate students. The School is highly respected internationally for the quality of its research and many of the staff who will teach you are among the world’s leading experts in their fields. Some famous start-up companies associated with the School are Iona Technologies, Havok, Demonware and DAFT.The demand for software and system designers will continue to grow within the next decade. When you graduate you will find opportunities for employment in software companies, financial institutions, large industrial organisations, research institutions and multinationals in Ireland as well as in Europe, the US and Asia.In the third year, you will learn how computer systems are constructed from the ground up. You will study low-level assembly language programming to develop a deep understanding of what lies beneath the C++ and Java programs you have written in earlier years. How Operating systems (such as Windows, iOS and Linux) regulate access to hardware and how networks build from simple point-to-point links up to global networks like the Internet are also studied both in theory and in the form of experiments. Encryption and other security-related topics are also covered. By the time you get to the fourth year, you are ready to undertake a major individual Capstone project which you can choose from and extensive menu offered by staff or you can opt to take an internship with an employer in the computer industry (multinational, local company or start-up). You can choose from a range of modules exploring how computers can render complex graphics, how they can see and understand video images and how this can be used with headset hardware for augmented reality. The ability of computers to harvest, store and process huge amounts of complex data is central to Computer Engineering, as are the energy and sustainability aspects of operating large cloud computing centres. You can further explore how hackers break into computer systems and how to defend against attack.The fifth (optional) year leads to a master’s degree (M.A.I.) in engineering and it is here that students get to carry out a major dissertation on a topic of their choice. This is a chance to really become a world-class expert in your favourite topic, researching what others have done across the world and building a hardware or software prototype that demonstrates this. As with the fourth year project, the topic could be anything from helping to manage huge cloud computing facilities through novel face-recognition algorithms to uncovering fraud in bitcoin transactions. To support your work on the Capstone project you can take a number of optional courses in the first semester including: Fuzzy Logic; Formal Methods; Advanced Computer Architecture; Embedded Systems; Distributed Systems; Networked Applications; Artificial Intelligence; Real Time Animation.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Every theology is contextual and political, but not every theology is liberative. The MPhil in Contextual Theologies and Interfaith Relations (CT&IR) is an interdisciplinary course that explores the inherent contextuality and pluralism of theological reflection, and especially their implications for inter- and intra- faith relations. ‘Faith’ here is understood broadly, drawing from a wide range of religions and spiritualities, some traditional and institutionally-structured, others more experimental and experiential. The course reflects the critical, self-critical and committed engagement with theological praxis on the part of the scholars who deliver it; modules pay close attention to the disciplined interplay of faith with the socio-political realm, both in terms of historical legacy and present possibility. Lectures and seminars probe key issues of the day, including faith’s complex relationships with social class, caste, race, ethnicity, nationhood, gender, sexuality and ecology. Students attend to the practical and theoretical possibilities of engaging – in depth and in context – with the challenging theological praxis of justice, peace and the integrity of creation. By offering a wide range of critically reflective faith perspectives from the Americas, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, this master’s course blends together the themes of liberation theologies, with those of ecumenical and interfaith dialogue.There are three main strands in the course:1. Religions, politics, ethics and pluralism in multiple contexts (e.g. Global South and Global North) with a particular focus on religion and secularity; religion and human rights; religion, conflict and peace; religion and race, caste, gender, sexualities; and religion and postcolonial/decolonial critique.2. Ecumenical dialogue, with a particular focus on how ecclesial communities reimagine formerly antagonistic relationships as part of a repentant reconfiguration of postcolonial and postimperial religious identities.3. Liberationist and interreligious theologies that blend interfaith dialogue with the themes of justice, peace, reconciliation and the integrity of creation involving Buddhist-Christian, Buddhist-Muslim, Hindu-Muslim, Christian-Muslim and Jewish-Christian and indigenous traditions.Lecturers draw on a wide range of critically engaging scholarly perspectives, including those of contextual, ecumenical and interreligious theologies; liberation/feminist/queer/peace theologies; historical theology and theological anthropology; Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic and Jewish studies; critical theories (postcolonial and postmodern); politics; sociology; and ethics.Liberationist and interfaith immersion programmes in the Middle East and South Asia, as well as the internship module, The Praxis of Contextual Theologies and Interfaith Relations, offer students the opportunities to engage with reflective practitioners in this field and make connections between theory and practice in their chosen field of study.The course also offers fieldwork visits to different places of worship in Dublin, a research trip to Belfast, and to the World Council of Churches in Geneva (which may be combined with the International Peace Studies visit to the United Nations).A range of international conferences will be made available for students who wish to participate and become familiar with established and emerging scholars in the field.Modules include: Research and Methods in Contextual Theologies and Interfaith Relations; Religions, Politics and Ethics in a Pluralist World; Reimagining Ecumenical Theology: Dialogue and Difference; Nature, Grace and Place: Theology, Maps and Territories;Liberationist and Interreligious Theologies; Issues in Buddhist-Christian Dialogue; Muslim God, Christian God: Islam and Muslim-Christian Comparative Theology; Engaging Religious Fundamentalism; Religions, Conflict and Peace in International Relations; Northern Ireland: Religion, Conflict and the Politics of Peace.Students on this course may also apply to take a module from one of the School of Religion’s other taught master’s courses for assessment in both Dublin and Belfast: International Peace Studies, Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation, and Christian Theology.This course provides an excellent opportunity to explore theological issues through the lens of inter- and intra-faith relations. Graduates of this course can go on to further education and academic research. Graduates will learn research skills, as well as analytic, written and verbal communication skills. These are highly valued and effective in a great variety of careers.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "This intensive full-time course provides professional training in Counselling Psychology and is accredited by the Psychological Society of Ireland. Admission is on a yearly basis for approximately 12 to 14 students. The three main objectives of the course are (1) to allow students to obtain a level of postgraduate academic and research performance appropriate for the award of a doctoral qualification, (2) to progress this academic and research performance through the practice of Counselling Psychology, and (3) to acquire professional knowledge and skills. The course emphasizes the scientist-practitioner model of training and research-informed practice. The scientist-practitioner model is fostered through research classes and work on the research dissertation. Students are informed on a variety of research strategies (including e.g., experimental, quasi-experimental as well as descriptive and qualitative, phenomenological, hermeneutic, discourse analytic and grounded theory approaches) and learn to critically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different methodologies. Graduates of this course are qualified counselling psychologists, skilled to conduct mental health assessments and therapy with individuals, couples, families and groups across the lifespanCourse Content and StructureTaught classes, as well as counselling skills training, clinical supervision and reflective practice modules emphasise the application of empirically informed psychological knowledge in the work of the counselling psychologist. Students are facilitated to be aware of current research findings and to incorporate these into their clinical practice. The first year of the course offers academic and practical skills training in Counselling Psychology and related research. After the first few weeks of concentrated, full time coursework and personal development work, at least 2 full days per week are spent on clinical placement and 2-3 days in classes. The D.Couns.Psych. offers a wide range of course approved placement options in community, health, mental health, education and private practice settings in the greater Dublin area and throughout the country. At least 3 different placements are required during the 3 years of the course. The course is committed to on-going development of placement provision with the aim to provide further opportunities for HSE recognized placements, which are required for eligibility to apply for HSE psychology posts. These placements are, however, subject to availability and may require a 3 day per week commitment. The second year involves further training in counselling theories and practice, and students conduct a research dissertation related to Counselling Psychology, initiated during the summer before entering second year.Personal development work, including individual therapy, is required throughout the 3 years. The third year includes small group supervision, reflective practice, and advanced counselling and psychotherapy theory and its application. However, the main focus will be on research. A research project resulting in the doctoral dissertation is carried throughout the three years. Courses are taught and supervision is provided by both core staff and other practitioners from varied theoretical orientations. Humanistic theory underlies the course. Psychodynamic and systemic perspectives are also emphasised, and training in cognitive behavioural approaches is provided. Practical placements continue through the summer and always follow the placement site's calendar, not that of the College. Guidelines for all aspects of the course are provided. All components of the course must be passed (i.e., practical, academic; research, and personal development), and subsequently validated by the Court of Examiners, who recommend students for the Doctorate in Counselling Psychology degree award.Graduates have pursued careers as counselling psychologists in a variety of settings, such as schools, hospitals, private companies, mental health facilities, and private practices. Graduates have also pursued further academic research, including PhDs.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "The Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity affords students the opportunity to develop insights into, and genuine appreciation for the culture, contributions, and contemporary issues related to Deaf people in Ireland and worldwide. The undergraduate programme is the only one of its kind in Ireland. Irish Sign Language (ISL) is the indigenous language of the Deaf Community in Ireland and is the working language at the Centre for Deaf Studies.ISL is a language like any other language, but it happens to be expressed in a different modality – sign languages use signs while spoken languages use sounds to express words. There are many different sign languages in the world in the same way as there are different spoken languages.ISL is the third language of Ireland, recognised in the Irish Sign Language Act (2017). It is also one of the many signed languages recognised by European Institutions and is recognised along with British Sign Language in Northern Ireland. During this four-year course students develop fluency in ISL. As a student you may choose to specialise as an ISL/English Interpreter or an ISL teacher, or to focus on Deaf Studies. Students entering the Deaf Studies programme will explore a range of educational, social, cultural, linguistic, and psychological issues and their application to Deaf people, as individuals, as a community, and as a linguistic and cultural minority.The multi-disciplinary approach to your studies is led by a strong academic team, many of whom are Deaf. The degree programme will provide in-depth training preparing you for a number of exciting career options working with Deaf people, in education, community and a range of other service settings, e.g., as a disability officer, resource officer, research assistant or as an administrator in Deaf community organisations. With this foundation, graduates frequently go on to complete postgraduate study.Deaf Studies is the right course for you if:The Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity has an international reputation for its work: we bring approaches from across many disciplines (linguistics, equality studies, psychology, education, disability studies, gender studies, interpreting studies, social policy and digital humanities) to bear on our work with Deaf communities.We engage closely with the Irish Deaf community and students will have the opportunity to learn from many of the world’s leading scholars in this discipline who collaborate with the Centre for Deaf Studies (CDS) staff.The pathways available are Single Honours and Major with Minor.Graduates frequently work in Deaf organisations, for example as a resource officer or combined with another skill set, such as teaching, Irish Sign Language (ISL)/ English interpreting, child care, social work, public service bodies, the Civil Service or the media. There is also scope for further study or research in areas such as linguistics, communications, anthropology, multiculturalism, gender studies or law.The programme in Deaf Studies draws on a core faculty with interests in Irish Sign Language and Deaf Studies, as well as other faculty within the University and the School of Linguistics Speech and Communication Sciences, with expertise in bilingualism, biculturalism, reading, literacy, linguistics and applied linguistics, cognitive and language development, language teaching, special education, and counselling. This course gives an in-depth understanding of the Irish Deaf community and of the experience of Deaf people internationally, historically and in contemporary society. Core courses detailing the history, education, literature and language of the Deaf will be taught by both Deaf and hearing staff.ISL is studied across the programme. In years two and three, themes such as ethics, Deaf people in the media, the legal and political standing of signed languages and access to critical public health services are explored, along with understanding of the structure of ISL, the sociolinguistic context and the path to acquisition of a signed language for deaf children. For ISL/English interpreting students, translation theory and the practical skills of interpreting, guided by ethical practice, are emphasised in third and fourth year.For students taking the ISL teaching route, guidance on planning and implementing a curriculum and assessing student performance are introduced. Students in the third and fourth year complete a Capstone research project.Across the four years of the degree you will develop a high level of competency in ISL skills. Language teaching is mapped to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR, Council of Europe), so you will be able to map your progress against your knowledge of other languages. Competence in Irish Sign Language is fundamental to gaining an in-depth understanding of the Deaf community and is a requirement of the programme.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.Theoretical courses introduce you to aspects of language acquisition, linguistics, sociolinguistics, social policy, and social studies. Each theoretical course involves two hours of lecture time per week plus an expectation of self-study.The course employs a wide range of teaching, learning and assessment strategies. Both continuous assessment and end of semester exams are undertaken across the four years. The range and diversity of assessment formats account for varying student learning styles.Students undertake practical placements in their fourth year and whilst students are usually placed in an Irish organisation, it is possible to arrange a placement abroad. Students can also consider completing an Erasmus exchange visit for this semester. ",

        "Overview": "Dental Science is the study of the oral cavity and the diseases associated with oral tissues. This five-year programme is designed to ensure that graduates can safely and effectively deliver the full range of primary dental care, including prevention, diagnosis and treatment of oral and dental diseases. If you have an ability to build caring and professional relationships with patients, co-workers and the wider community and if oral healthcare and its impact on individuals interests you, then Dental Science is right for you. You should also enjoy undertaking physically and mentally demanding clinical practice, which requires considerable attention to detail with small margins for error. The course is long (five years) and intense, requiring stamina and commitment.This course is based in the Dublin Dental University Hospital situated on the Trinity campus. Clinical facilities are of a very high standard, emphasising the use of information technology. Class sizes are small, to ensure that students receive considerable staff input into their progress throughout the programme. Much of the teaching is delivered through Problem-Based Learning and there is lots of hands-on clinical experience treating patients. Students are introduced to clinical practice in first year as observers and they commence treating their own patients (under supervision) in the second year. By the fifth year students are expected to have completed a wide range of treatments similar to those provided in general dental practice. Graduates of the Trinity School of Dental Science and Dublin Dental University Hospital are highly sought after due to the extensive clinical exposure obtained during the programme.Graduates of the Dental Science programme in Trinity are widely recognised for their clinical experience and are highly sought after. There is a wide range of career options open to newly qualified dentists, from general dental practice providing both state-funded or private dental care, or in the salaried public dental service. Many graduates choose to continue their education, specialising in one area within dentistry. Dentistry gives scope to work and travel worldwide. Citizens of the EU who graduate from an EU dental school may practice anywhere in the EU and there is currently demand for dentists all over Europe.The Bachelor of Dental Science (B.Dent.Sc) conferred by Trinity entitles EU citizens to register as a dentist on the Register of the Dental Council of Ireland and they may also register with the regulatory bodies of other countries in the EU. Graduates wishing to practice in countries outside the EU may be required to pass specified examinations. However, there is a mutual recognition agreement between Ireland and Canada whereby Irish dental graduates may practice dentistry in Canada without the necessity to complete additional study.The curriculum is largely delivered in a problem-based learning format, which aims to provide you with the skills to continuously evaluate and update your knowledge and clinical practice throughout your professional career. PBL encourages students to engage in self-directed learning and aims to provide graduates with the skills necessary for life-long learning, which is a requirement for all health care professionals. Lectures, demonstrations, simulations, audio-visual and e-learning opportunities are also provided. From second year onwards, you will provide patient care in the clinic under the strict supervision of qualified dental staff.Personal and Professional Development, Human Biology I, Physical Science. During the second semester, you will begin observing on the clinic.Basic Dental Care, Human Biology II, Oral Biology and Introduction to Pathology, Public Dental Health.In second year, you will develop particular communication skills, learning how to interpret and explain clinical signs and symptoms of systemic and oral disease with particular reference to dental practice, and begin to practice the clinical skills necessary for the treatment of patients. Clinical training begins half way through second year with students learning the vital basic skills of history taking, examination and diagnosis and will start providing very simple treatments for patients.Clinical Medical Sciences, Fixed and Removable Prosthodontics, Comprehensive Patient Care I.Comprehensive Patient Care II; Advanced Restorative Dentistry I, Child Dental Health; Oral Medicine, Oral Surgery and Oral Pathology I; Public Dental Health.Comprehensive Patient Care III, Advanced Restorative Dentistry II, Public and Child Dental Health, Oral Medicine, Oral Surgery and Oral Pathology II, Evidence-Based Dentistry.During years 3 to 5, you will be encouraged to undertake the management of oral health and disease in your own patients. In tandem with this, you will also need an awareness of general healthcare issues for individuals and communities. In these three years, you will provide more complex patient care.In keeping with the PBL-style curriculum, a wide variety of assessment methods are used in all years. There are end-of-term integrated written assessments, practical tests, skills tests of competence, clinical examinations, written reports and oral/verbal presentations. The written assessments include short essays, short answer and multiple choice type questions.Click here for further information on modules/subject.Students in fourth year may participate in English-speaking Erasmus exchange programmes with dental schools in Norway and Sweden.

        "Overview": "Dental technicians work in a laboratory which is usually remote from the dental clinic. Dental technicians work to the prescription of a dentist; they perform the laboratory aspects of dentistry – fabricating crowns and bridges, dentures, implants, maxillofacial and orthodontic appliances, which are intended for use by the patient. Dental technicians have good manual dexterity skills and are required to work with different materials for the fabrication of the various appliances. Dental technology is a changing field, with more emphasis on the use of CAD (Computer Aided Design)/CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) in the laboratory.The study of dental technology will appeal to you if you are interested in science and art, combined with working in a team. If you have an interest in oral health and are simultaneously creatively minded then dental technology may be for you. A good background in basic sciences and a flair for art or good manual dexterity skills are essential to becoming an excellent dental technician. Dental technology also requires precise and scientific expression therefore, good writing skills are important.Trinity College Dublin is the only university in Ireland offering a degree in Dental Technology. The course is based in the Dublin Dental University Hospital, on the Trinity College, with state-of-the-art facilities, including Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) of dental appliances in close proximity to the clinical environment. Class sizes are small, ensuring that students receive considerable staff contact and the staff are actively involved in student progress throughout the programme.This course provides students with a well-rounded education in all aspects of dental technology whilst also challenging their ability to problem-solve. A Dental Technology degree provides the best foundation for the aspiring dental technician who may progress to work in a laboratory or be self-employed. Dental Technology offers the scope to work and travel abroad. The Dublin Dental University Hospital has recently introduced a Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Dental Technology; one of the prerequisites to securing a place on this course is a qualification in Dental Technology.Dental Technology at Trinity is a three-year ordinary degree programme. Most of the teaching takes place in the Dublin Dental University Hospital (DDUH). The main aim of the course is to educate and train students to become part of the dental team for the planning, designing and fabrication of intra-oral appliances. Dental Technology is divided into four main areas – fixed prosthodontics, complete denture technology, removable denture technology and orthodontic technology. In the first and second years, a Dental Technology student will spend much of their time (6-8 x 3 hour sessions per week) in the DDUH teaching laboratory. The course is very much hands-on right from the start. Student numbers are small (6), which facilitates practical training of this nature. There is a strong emphasis on student integration with Dental Science students and some modules are integrated accordingly.In the third year, students are assigned to the production laboratory for experience in providing a service to patients and clinicians. This offers a competitive advantage over graduates from many other universities. Liaison with the Dental Science students and clinical staff is encouraged and students are advised to attend in the clinic to observe their completed work in situ. There is the opportunity for students to be placed in external laboratories and there is a possibility of Erasmus exchange in this year too. Students will be busy throughout the year preparing a dissertation, which is presented at the end of the year in addition to a case portfolio of the practical work which the student has carried out over the course of the year.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Many of the biggest questions in our world today can only be answered by drawing on knowledge of both culture and technology. Trinity’s MPhil in Digital Humanities and Culture prepares its students to take on these questions in a wide variety of contexts, whether they want to deepen their understanding of a humanities subject through data mining and visualisation; explore the virtual transmission of culture and heritage by and beyond museums, libraries and archives; or join the movement to make technology development more humane. In the digital humanities, researchers trained in history, literature, languages, the arts, computer science and engineering combine their skills to transform our understanding of the world. They also develop the technological capacity to drive forward our ability to see patterns in human behaviours and how humans describe their experiences. What sets apart our course from other Digital Humanities courses is the equal emphasis we place on what technology can do for humanities research, and what humanities research can do to promote the rise of human-centred technology design. We also use the established collaborations across our disciplines and with our library and technical support colleagues to deliver a unique educational experience. The flow of challenges, knowledge and techniques between students and staff in the course from diverse backgrounds creates many unexpected and transformative opportunities to grow our understanding of the world.Whether your background is in in the humanities, arts, information management, cultural heritage or computer science, the MPhil in Digital Humanities and Culture will give you the skills to:• Apply cutting-edge methods to interrogate the most fundamental questions of literature, history and the arts.• Deepen your understanding of cultural practices and tensions in the digital age.• Build your own digital projects, honing your existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills and gaining new ones.• Experience how a professional organisation manages the impact of technology on culture in an internship setting.• Work and learn alongside the members of the many active research project teams of the Trinity Centre for Digital Humanities.The MPhil and the Centre for Digital HumanitiesStudents on the Master’s in Digital Humanities and Culture are encouraged to participate in the activities, projects and network of the Trinity Centre for Digital Humanities (www.dh.tcd.ie). Trinity is internationally recognised for its research in this field, and maintains a lively team of DH researchers, projects, partners and visitors. The Trinity Centre for Digital Humanities acts as a conduit between researchers at Trinity and the nationally recognised, ADAPT, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Digital Media Technology (https://www.adaptcentre.ie/), the DARIAH ERIC European Research Infrastructure for Arts and Humanities (www.dariah.eu), and as a wide network of international research partners based in world class institutions such as the Humboldt University (Berlin), the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (Paris) and the Digital Archiving and Networking Service of the Netherlands (the Hague). MPhil, Diploma and Certificate OptionsThe programme can be accessed via three different entry routes, each of which offers its own advantages. With the Postgraduate Certificate, students complete three modules (2 required, 1 elective) to develop a basic understanding of and fluency with the methods and contexts of the digital humanities. With the Postgraduate Diploma, students complete six modules (4 required, 2 elective) to obtain a thorough grounding in both the theory and the practice underpinning the digital humanities. Finally, with the Master’s of Philosophy, students will have the opportunity to apply what they have learned in their coursework through the development of a research dissertation.The Educational ExperiencePostgraduate CertificatePostgraduate Certificate students take three modules in total. Two of these take a theoretical approach, focussing during the Michaelmas term on the Theory and Practice of Digital Humanities and in Hilary term on Cultural-Technical Systems.

        "Overview": "The micro-credential is designed to meet the digital skill needs of professionals working in human services such as social work and social care work and those who manage such services. Firstly, it aims to increase learners’ awareness of the use of digital technologies in human services and then to increase their ability to assess the benefits and challenges of implementing technology in human service work. Learners will develop practice skills through the evaluation of technology’s impact on professional practice e.g. reach and social presence, privacy, boundaries, risk and relationship management.The use of digital technologies in the provision of human services such as social work, health and education has gained momentum following the ‘pivot’ in response to Covid-19. Supported by a European and national policy agenda driving digital transformation, human services are increasingly delivered and managed partly or wholly using such technologies. Service provision and user communication frequently draws on technologies such as video conferencing and social media.This MC aims to provider learners with an understanding of the policy context and other drivers of digital technology use in human services and the considerable scope for the use of such technologies in human service delivery. The organisations which provide human services display distinctive features such as co-production with service users and they operate in complex contexts subject to statutory regulation and political influence. The MC aims to facilitate an assessment of the benefits and challenges associated with technology use given these factors and evaluate the impact of technology use on stakeholders in human services. Learners will engage directly with the benefits and challenges of digital technologies for their own employers through the MC.",

        "Overview": "Drama exists on and off the stage. Theatre happens in our everyday life. It is the basis for story-telling and other forms of performance within the creative arts. It has its origins in sacred ritual and remains central today as part of our sensemaking as we negotiate our place in the world. As with other creative arts, Drama and the insights from studying performance can be applied in the fields of medicine, politics, education and more.Theatre Studies encompass all the arts that make up the live experience we call theatre – including costume, lighting, sound, devising, directing, design, dramaturgy and playwriting. We also study the meaning behind theatre, analysing culture and politics, space and place, the presence of audience and performers, and the use of digital technology.Do you enjoy:All Drama pathways explore the relationship between the theory and practice of Drama and Theatre to discover how and why they work. The strong developmental emphasis of the courses requires a particular blend of practical and academic skills. In addition to a high level of analytical ability and creativity, you will need to possess resourcefulness and self-motivation.Teaching is by lecture, seminar and workshop, with a strong emphasis on experiential learning and practice-based research through theatre laboratory and production opportunities. This leads to a relatively high number of contact hours with other students for group projects, as well as the regularly timetabled taught classes.

During these years, the course introduces drama, theatre and performance, and places them in a contemporary and relevant context. Teaching is by lecture, seminar and practical workshop, covering Theatre History (from the Greeks to the present), Performance Analysis, and Contemporary Performance Research (including studies in semiotics, feminism and gender, dramaturgy, postmodernism and more). Single Honours students also take courses in practical areas of theatre (Embodied Practices, Performance and Technology, and Crew Rotation). Training in study, research, and writing skills is provided to support you with the academic elements of the course.Student choose from a wide range of optional modules, striking a balance between the academic and the practical nature of the course (based on your chosen exit pathway).The range of modules allows you to favour study in historical and theoretical fields or in practical aspects of theatre. The range of options may include theatre and Ireland, embodied Shakespeare, stage, costume and lighting design, playwriting, devising, directing, theatre management, acting, performance and technology, women and theatre, and applied drama and theatre. Students exiting through Drama as a Major, Joint Honours, or Single Honours subject also complete a staff-supervised Capstone project. The Drama Capstone project allows students to integrate their interests into an individual research submission (such as a long dissertation or blended practice-as-research).Assessment is by a combination of essays, reflections, practical assignments, class presentations, oral examinations Students exiting through Drama via Major, Joint Honours or Single Honours subject are required to complete a Capstone project.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course.

        "Overview": "Drama exists on and off the stage. Theatre happens in our everyday life. It is the basis for story-telling and other forms of performance within the creative arts. It has its origins in sacred ritual and remains central today as part of our sense making as we negotiate our place in the world. As with other creative arts, Drama and the insights from studying performance can be applied in the fields of medicine, politics, education and more.Theatre Studies encompass all the arts that make up the live experience we call theatre – including costume, lighting, sound, devising, directing, design, dramaturgy and playwriting. We also study the meaning behind theatre, analysing culture and politics, space and place, the presence of audience and performers, and the use of digital technology.All Drama pathways explore the relationship between the theory and practice of Drama and Theatre to discover how and why they work. The strong developmental emphasis of the courses requires a particular blend of practical and academic skills. In addition to a high level of analytical ability and creativity, you will need to possess resourcefulness and self-motivation.Teaching is by lecture, seminar and workshop, with a strong emphasis on experiential learning and practice-based research through theatre laboratory and production opportunities.

        "Overview": "The M.Phil course in Early Modern History offers well-qualified graduates in History, the Humanities and the Social Sciences an introduction to research in the political, social, cultural and religious history of Ireland, Britain and Europe across the early modern period. This one-year course (or two years part-time) is designed to introduce students to a wide range of issues in, and approaches to, early modern history. It also provides students with training in research methods and skills. The course is built around Trinity College Library’s unparalleled resources for the period from the Reformation to the French Revolution. The course may also serve as an introduction to graduate study for students intending to pursue doctoral studies. The core module for this course is From Reform to Revolution: Cultural Change and Political Conflict in Early Modern Europe. Students also choose two major of study, one in each term. Availability of modules varies from year to year. Subjects recently offered include: Religious Tolerance and Intolerance in Early Modern Europe; War and Society in Early Modern Ireland and Europe; The War of Ideas in the English Revolution; Gender, Identity and Authority in Eighteenth-Century France; Renaissance Kingship. In addition, students take modules focussed on research training and skills. These are designed to introduce the diverse resources and methodologies that historians encounter in their research while also equipping students with the practical skills that are required for the study of early modern history. The Research Seminar in Early Modern History provides an opportunity for invited early modernists from Ireland and elsewhere to discuss their work with graduate students. The capstone of the course is the independent dissertation project. Students complete dissertations of between 15,000 and 20,000 words based on their own primary research.

        "Overview": "Early Irish can be studied in the Single Honour Early and Modern Irish programme (TR022). Early Irish is the language in use in Ireland from the earliest period for which there are records up to the year 1200. The course covers the language and literature from the emergence of writing at the arrival of Christianity in Ireland to the production of the great saga manuscripts of the twelfth century.If you are interested in acquiring a reading knowledge of Medieval Irish, in which the great saga literature of our manuscripts was written, and if you want to understand where today’s Irish language comes from, then this is the course for you.The Irish department staff at Trinity are recognised as experts in their respective fields and many former students are now teaching in universities at home and abroad. You will enjoy small class sizes and a friendly atmosphere. The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours. There may also be an opportunity to take this subject up as a New Minor Subject from second year.Some students of Early Irish pursue independent research in the subject with a view to teaching at third-level. Most follow a career in teaching or journalism, especially Irish-language related media. Library archiving, the public service, marketing, business, interpreting and translation all figure in the profiles of past students.The Early Irish course, which is taught through the medium of English, covers the history of the Irish language from its first appearance on the Ogam inscriptions at the dawn of the Christian era in the fifth century, to the highly polished language of the sagas and law texts preserved in the medieval manuscript collections held in the libraries of Trinity, the Royal Irish Academy and the National LibraryIn the first two years you will study the basics of Old Irish. At this stage you will read most literature in translation but you will be introduced to the original texts gradually and you will see how the language emerged and developed through the early Christian period.In third and fourth year the horizons are expanded; your study of the history of the language will take you back to its Celtic origins and forward to the dawn of Modern Irish. At this stage you will be reading prose and poetry as well as law and history in the original language, and a special course in palaeography will teach you how to read the manuscripts themselves. Third year students may opt to spend a term in Aberystwyth learning Medieval and Modern Welsh.At all levels, you will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of traditional and innovative continuous assessment methods: essays, project work, presentations, book reviews and dossiers, podcast creation. Language modules are assessed by written examination. There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.Tugtar ‘Nua-Ghaeilge’ ar an teanga ón mbliain 1200 go dtí an lá atá inniu ann. Sa chúrsa seo léitear litríocht ó gach cuid den tréimhse agus déantar staidéar ar fhorás na teanga lena linn. Déantar staidéar speisialta freisin ar Ghaeilge an lae inniu agus ar Ghaeilge na hAlban. Tá cáil ar fhoireann Roinn na Gaeilge sna goirt ina bhfuil siad ag obair mar scoláirí agus iad ag foilsiú leo go rialta. Chomh maith leis sin, tá an-cháil ar an Roinn as a bheith cairdiúil, rud a thaitníonn go mór lenár gcuid mac léinn. Bíonn líon na mac léinn beag go leor le go mbíonn sé éasca do na mic léinn aithne a chur ar a chéile. Tá Cumann Gaelach na mac léinn an-ghníomhach ar fad; tá scéim chónaithe lánGhaeilge a bhfuil an-tóir uirthi sa Choláiste. San iomlán, is geall le mionGhaeltacht i lár na príomhchathrach sinn. Tá réimse an-leathan gairmeacha ag daoine a rinne Nua-Ghaeilge anseo. Ina measc tá cuid mhaith múinteoirí, iriseoirí (sna meáin Ghaeilge go háirithe) agus daoine le postanna eile sna meáin: teilifís, ceol, beochan, raidió agus an t-idirlíon. Tá borradh tagtha ar líon na ndaoine a fhaigheann postanna mar ateangairí agus aistritheoirí, in Éirinn agus san Eoraip. Tá léachtóirí ollscoile agus leabharlannaithe againn chomh maith, agus iarmhic léinn eile ag obair sa tseirbhís phoiblí, le gnó agus le margaíocht.Is trí mheán na Gaeilge a mhúinfear do chúrsa. Foghlaimeoidh tú faoi gach gné den NuaGhaeilge: ón bhFiannaíocht sa 13ú haois go Máirtín Ó Cadhain agus Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill agus litríocht an lae inniu. Cuirfidh tú go mór le do chumas i labhairt agus scríobh na Gaeilge, agus déanfaidh tú staidéar foirmiúil ar cheartúsáid na teanga. Beidh deis agat freastal ar léachtaí faoi: scéalaíocht na seanré, stair shóisialta na teanga, an béaloideas, filíocht na scol, an Fhiannaíocht agus an nualitríocht ar fad, i.e. gearrscéalta, drámaíocht, úrscéalta, dírbheathaisnéisí agus filíocht. Caithfidh tú dhá mhí sa Ghaeltacht in Éirinn mar chuid de do chúrsa. Sainghné speisialta de chúrsa na Nua-Ghaeilge i gColáiste na Tríonóide ná gur anseo amháin a bheidh seans agat trí bliana a chaitheamh le Gaeilge na hAlban (a’ Ghàidhlig). Beidh seans agat, más mian leat, tréimhse a chaitheamh i nGaeltacht na hAlban freisin.Sa chéad bhliain agus sa dara bliain, díríonn an cúrsa ar na hábhair seo a leanas: scileanna i labhairt agus scríobh na teanga, an cheapadóireacht, an t-aistriúchán, stair shóisialta na Gaeilge, an Ghaeilge Chlasaiceach, an nualitríocht, Gaeilge na hAlban. Sa tríú bliain agus sa cheathrú bliain, díríonn an cúrsa ar na hábhair seo a leanas: ardscileanna teanga (labhartha agus scríofa), an cheapadóireacht agus an t-aistriúchán ag leibhéal níos airde, agus Gaeilge na hAlban. Foghlaimeoidh tú conas lámhscríbhinní a léamh (cúrsa sa phailéagrafaíocht) agus léirmheastóireacht chriticiúil a dhéanamh ar scéalaíocht na seanré. Ina theannta sin, déanfaidh tú rogha cúrsaí sa Nua-Ghaeilge Mhoch, sa litríocht bhéil, i nualitríocht na Gaeilge agus/nó i nualitríocht Ghaeilge na hAlban.Déanann gach mac léinn cleachtaí scríofa gach seachtain mar chuid den mheasúnú leanúnach; bíonn aistí le scríobh go tráthrialta, agus béaltriail agus scrúduithe scríofa ag deireadh an téarma. Sa cheathrú bliain, déanann mic léinn taighde neamhspleách agus scríobhann siad miontráchtas.Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire a dhéanann leathbhliain thar sáile. Cé nach féidir staidéar a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge thar sáile mar chuid de bhunchéim sa Nua-Ghaeilge, is féidir le mic léinn le Gaeilge, agus le Gaeilge agus ábhar eile leathbhliain a chaitheamh in ollscoil thar lear sa tríú bliain. Sa chás sin, déanfaidh siad a gcúrsa Gaeilge in aon leathbhliain amháin i gColáiste na Tríonóide, agus caithfidh siad an leathbhliain eile thar lear ag díriú go huile is go hiomlán ar an ábhar eile atá idir lámha acu.",

        "Overview": "Any society has to address the problem of how and what to produce for its material survival, and how the goods and services that are produced should be distributed among its population. Economists explore how people and institutions behave and function when producing, exchanging and using goods and services. Economists’ main motivation is to find mechanisms that encourage efficiency in the production and use of material goods and resources, while at the same time producing a pattern of income distribution that society finds acceptable.Economics will appeal to students with a wide range of interests. If you are interested in current economic affairs or in understanding how public policies could lower unemployment or assist the developing world, then you will find studying economics both stimulating and rewarding. Economics is also a strong platform for careers in business and finance. Students who enjoy abstract thinking, and are evaluating courses such as engineering or physics, should also consider economics as a degree option.In the 2020 QS rankings Trinity was ranked in the top 150 universities in the world for Economics and Econometrics. The Department of Economics, in the school of Social Sciences and Philosophy, places considerable emphasis on providing a supportive and stimulating teaching environment for all students. In addition to lectures, which are given by highly qualified academic staff with international reputations, the Department facilitates learning through approachable staff, small tutorial groups, student presentations, and time set aside each week by all staff and teaching assistants to meet students on a one-to-one basis. Furthermore, students gain valuable experience and exposure to economics through involvement in societies and debates and in the annual publication of the ‘Student Economic Review.’Economics students develop exceptional logical reasoning and analytical skills which are highly sought after by employers in a range of fields including business, finance, journalism, law, politics, the public service and academia.The following are just a few examples of the diverse organisations where economics graduates work: Dublin Web Summit, Abbott, Goldman Sachs, Google, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Accenture, Morgan Stanley, Irish Life, Wolfhound Press, Maersk, Central Bank of Ireland and KPMG.About a quarter of economics graduates go on to postgraduate study, both at Trinity and at other leading universities around the world such as Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge and the London School of Economics.Most of the teaching takes place at lecture level and is complemented by tutorials (small group teaching). In the first two years, teaching emphasises the understanding of the basic principles of economics and the acquisition of the quantitative and analytical skills necessary for more in-depth study. The student will also receive instruction on how the modern economy works both from an Irish and a global perspective. In third and fourth year, there are very few compulsory modules. Students are therefore able to construct their own programme from a wide range of options.All modules in the first three years are assessed by a combination of continuous assessment (tests or essays) and the formal end-of-semester examinations. Fewer modules are required in the fourth and final year so as to facilitate time for more independent work.Project work is a very important component of almost all modules within the final year; this project work allows students to achieve a very high level of expertise in a number of specific areas and is very beneficial to students when setting out on their career paths. In addition, students specialising exclusively in economics in fourth year complete a Capstone project on a chosen topic.Introduction to Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Introduction to Economic Policy and a selection of optional modules.Intermediate Economics, Economy of Ireland, Mathematical and Statistical Methods.Some of the modules which may be available to study are:Economic Analysis; Money and Banking; European Economy; Economics of Less Developed Countries; Investment Analysis; Economics of Policy Issues; Industrial Economics: Competition, Strategy and Policy; Mathematical Economics; Econometrics; Economic Theory; World Economy; Development Economics; Economics of Financial Markets; International Economics; Economic and Legal Aspects of Competition Policy; Applied Economics; History of Economic Thought and Policy; Topics in Political Economy.A combination of final examinations and continual assessments (e.g. essays, projects, term tests).There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Students have the opportunity to spend some time in their third year studying in distinguished partner institutions in Australia, France, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands for either an academic year or for half an academic year; the majority of outgoing students go abroad for half an academic year.

        "Overview": "This course in Economics leads to the award of a Master in Science (Economics) (M.Sc. (Econ)). The objective of the course is to provide well-qualified graduates in economics and related disciplines with the training required to work as economists in the public, private and non-profit sectors or to enter Ph.D. programmes in economics. The course focuses on the technical skills needed to undertake economic research and emphasises active and problem-based learning to ensure mastery of the required skills.The course has two strands. The first is a general entry strand and the second is a strand that focuses on International Development. While the required mix of modules varies across the two, the structure and timing of both is the same and both lead to an M.Sc. (Econ) qualification.Both strands are available on a full-time or part-time basis. The full-time course takes one year, while the part-time course runs over two academic years. All students on all strands must take an intensive preliminary course in mathematics and statistics at the start of the first semester, while the second semester starts with a Research Methods course.The MSc programme is structured around the following components: 1. An intensive mathematics and statistics module at the start of Semester 1, which is compulsory for all students.2. Six taught four-week modules in Semester 1: Econometrics modules are required for all students.3. A Research Topics module at the start of Semester 2, which is compulsory for all students.4. Six taught four-week modules in Semester 2: Econometrics modules are required for all students.5. The research-based dissertation, due in late June, allows students to showcase the knowledge they have gained by identifying and answering a research question.In addition to mandatory Econometrics modules, students on the International Development strand will have other required modules.Assessment on the M.Sc. register will be based on coursework and the dissertation. The pass mark is 50%.To qualify for the award of the M.Sc. (Econ.), students must have an overall average mark of at least 50% and achieve a pass mark in the dissertation and in each module. Students who fail the dissertation will be eligible for the award of Postgraduate Diploma in Economics, provided they complete 60 ECTS.Further details are available on the course website.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Electronic Engineering apply to the Engineering degree (TR032).The first two years are common to all Engineering students and at the end of the second-year students select Electronic Engineering as their specialist area.Technology has evolved significantly in the last 20 years and it is no longer so easy to separate the skills of design engineers in Electronic Engineering and Computer Engineering. Therefore Trinity offers three specialties in the area: Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering and Electronic & Computer Engineering. If you are interested in Electronic Engineering you should also consider Electronic & Computer Engineering and Computer Engineering.Until recently it was possible to define the skillset of an Electronic Engineer as related to the design of hardware chips that could, for instance, be found in computers and consumer devices. In fact it is a continuously evolving profession and is the driving force behind the development of the world’s information technology. Electronic engineers create, design and develop everyday devices like the mobile phone, tablets, game engines and computers. In particular they increasingly design systems which are at the interface between decision making systems and actions in the real world. That means an engineer in this specialty has to also have a working knowledge of software engineering since all engineers now exploit software design to implement ideas and prototypes.The careers open to graduates in electronic engineering range from circuit design in semiconductor companies, through network design and management in telecommunications companies, media engineering in Netflix, YouTube and the entire cinema postproduction industry. There are opportunities in business and financial management, where systems for high speed calculations are the driving force behind the modern stock market. Companies employing Electronic Engineering graduates include Boston Scientific, Universal Robots, Xilinx, Intel, Netflix, YouTube, Disney, Ericsson, Analog Devices, Google, EirGrid, SIG, JumpTrading and Accenture.You begin in the first two years with fundamentals of hardware circuit design and data analysis. You will be given a foundation in how analogue and digital electronic circuits work, taste the systems used for high level chip design and even experiment with autonomous vehicle control. In the third year your specialism deepens to include digital analysis of signals as a preparation for Machine Learning in the subsequent years. You will also delve into how information is coded and transmitted in radio links used in mobile phone networks and satellite communication. All electronic engineers must have a working knowledge of software design and so on the computing side, you will learn how the basic analogue and digital circuits combine to form complex processors (CPUs), how these are programmed at machine level (assembly language) and be introduced to fundamentals of software design.By the time you get to the fourth year, you are ready to undertake a major individual Capstone project which you can choose from an extensive menu offered by staff or you can opt to take an internship with an employer in the computing and electronics industries. You can choose from a range of modules exploring biomedical electronics, entertainment system design, machine learning and reconfigurable hardware design. Students also have the opportunity to choose specialist telecommunications and data analysis modules. Opportunities are offered to undertake a placement in industry or with a research group or to spend some time studying abroad through the Unitech, Erasmus or Cluster programmes. Examples of companies that accepted our students include Intel, SIG, Boston Scientific, Qualcomm etc.The fifth (optional) year leads to a master’s degree (M.A.I.) in engineering and it is here that students get to carry out a major dissertation on a topic of their choice. This is a chance to really become a world-class expert in your favourite topic, researching what others have done across the world and building a hardware or software prototype that demonstrates this. As with the fourth year project, the topic could be anything from wireless communications, signal processing systems, biomedical devices and systems, helping to manage huge cloud computing facilities, through novel facerecognition algorithms to uncovering fraud in bitcoin transactions. To support your work on the dissertation, you can take a number of optional courses in the first semester including: Motion Picture Engineering; Speech and Audio Engineering; Wireless Networks and Communications; Advanced Computer Architecture; Artificial Intelligence and Realtime Animation.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Engineering is about being creative in technical problem solving. Engineers make things possible by using mathematical and scientific principles together with analytical and design skills. They tackle existing problems by developing new solutions through innovative technologies.They also expand the frontiers of society by developing advanced materials, sustainable energy systems, construction technologies, transport systems, biomedical devices and telecommunications infrastructure.We have been teaching Engineering at Trinity since 1841. There have been immense developments since that time, but the continuity of excellence in teaching and learning is a source of pride for us and our graduates. A distinctive feature of Engineering at Trinity is the two-year common programme, in which all students learn the fundamentals of Engineering science and also engage in substantial elements of project work prior to choosing a specific engineering discipline. Trinity is the top-ranked university in Ireland, and our Engineering graduates use this to their advantage all over the world as well as in Ireland.Engineering is a constantly evolving profession. As an engineer, you will need to be adaptable both to the rapid development of new ideas and technology and to the shifting requirements of industry and society. You will need to be a good communicator and be capable of working as part of a team. Above all, you must be a problem solver. You must be creative and able to synthesise and analyse information from different sources to arrive at efficient and practical solutions.Trinity is ranked in the top 120 universities worldwide for Engineering (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020) and offers outstanding teaching by engineers who are at the forefront of their field worldwide. It has a strong philosophy of research-led teaching and continuously benchmarks itself against the top international engineering schools. The Engineering course offers the opportunity to carry out research as part of your course with the aim of producing graduates capable of participating to research projects at the highest national and international levels. There are opportunities for work placements in Ireland and abroad as well as study abroad opportunities as part of the degree programme. The engineering programme is fully accredited by Engineers Ireland up to Masters level (M.A.I) and offers excellent career prospects in Ireland and abroad.Engineering graduates from Trinity have the capacity to think independently but also to work in teams. They can use technical understanding to problem solve in a wide range of technical areas. They are able to communicate their technical and creative ideas to other professionals and to society at large. They are able to take responsibility, deal with complexity and ambiguity and successfully face open-ended challenges.The B.A.I/M.A.I (Engineering) degree programme is based on two years of general engineering, providing students with a firm grounding in the principles common to all disciplines, followed by two/three years of specialisation. Graduates are professionally accredited engineers with both a broad-based understanding of the whole discipline and a detailed knowledge of their chosen specialist area. The aim is that graduates will be able to continuously train themselves, to adapt and move into related or newly emerging areas as their careers develop after graduation.All students follow a common programme for the first two years. The first year comprises introductory courses in engineering science, mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, mechanics, electricity and magnetism, graphics and computer-aided engineering, and a group design and build project.In the second year, students take further engineering science modules, such as solids and structures, thermo-fluids and electronics, and complete two more group design and build projects. This allows you to explore all the possibilities open to you in advance of making your final decision about which specialism to concentrate on. You will also take a Trinity Elective module. While every effort is made to allow students to study the course they choose, in some departments the number of places for students of any one year may be limited (this has never been necessary so far).At the end of second year you choose one of the six specialist areas:Courses in the third and fourth years aim to broaden and deepen your knowledge and understanding of the specialism you have chosen. You will also have the opportunity to take a Trinity Elective module and approved modules in other disciplines. Subjects are studied in much greater detail and students undertake real-life, practical projects. For example, if you choose Civil, Structural and Environmental Engineering you could end up testing the pre-cast concrete used to build the Paddington to Heathrow railway; If you choose Computer Engineering, you might find yourself building a microprocessor system.Engineering students require a Masters degree to be directly eligible for Chartered Engineer status with Engineers Ireland. Therefore the School offers several options for a fifth year leading to a masters degree (MAI). Students can spend the fourth and fifth year in Trinity, undertaking additional modules in their specialisation and approved modules in other disciplines as well as a group project in fourth year and a significant individual Capstone project in fifth year.Students also have the option of spending the second semester of their fourth year undertaking a supervised internship placement. The remainder of their fourth year and the fifth year are spent in Trinity undertaking additional modules in the specialisation and approved modules in other disciplines. Students complete a significant individual Capstone project in 5th year.Students have the option to spend their fourth year abroad as part of the Erasmus/International exchange, CLUSTER or UNITECH programmes. As part of the Erasmus/International exchange or CLUSTER programmes, students spend their fourth year abroad at a partner university and return to complete their fifth year at Trinity. Some of our Erasmus/International exchange partner universities include Institut National de Sciences Appliquées de Lyon – INSA, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM), Politecnico di Torino and University of Melbourne. The CLUSTER programme is a consortium of 12 universities including Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona; Technische Universität Darmstadt; Technische Universiteit Eindhoven; Institut polytechnique de Grenoble; Instituto Superior Técnico Lisbon; Katholieke Universiteit Leuven/Université Catholique de Louvain; Helsinki University of Technology; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne; Politecnico di Torino; KTH Royal Institute of Technology Stockholm.The UNITECH programme is a collaboration of 8 partner Universities and 16 multinational corporate partners.

        "Overview": "What is Engineering with Management? Engineering with Management is an exciting and wide-ranging engineering programme that is broad in scope and aims to develop both the technical and business aspects of engineering. Engineers are problem solvers. In almost every human endeavour, an engineer has been involved somewhere. They have created the designs and systems to make everything from: gliders to space craft, ball-point pens to laser printers, matchbox cars to F1 racing cars, wheelchairs to artificial joints for the human body.Engineering with Management is concerned with the analysis, design, improvement, installation and management of integrated systems of people, finance, materials and equipment. Our graduates have the technical skills common to all excellent engineers, with this knowledge augmented by an understanding of the commercial and industrial environment and the ability to generate innovative solutions to the problems of the world.Do you enjoy…Engineering with Management: The course for you?Do you like the creative, analytical, problem-solving focus of engineering? Do you like the diversity of engineering? Perhaps, though, you see your professional life more involved with running a company, managing projects, or being a consultant? If any of these describes you, then you should consider this course. The diversity and flexibility of this course will give you endless possibilities in your professional life, both in what you do and how you do it. As well as providing the core competencies for employment in research, manufacturing, production, design and engineering consultancy, the breadth of the course equips graduates to compete favourably with general graduates for careers in the business and financial sectors.Engineering with Management at TrinityA key feature of the engineering with management programme is that the class size is capped at 30 students. This reflects a core belief in the value of small-group teaching and hands-on exercises, which is delivered through active learning strategies implemented by our world-class staff. The course is a professional engineering degree, fully accredited by Engineers Ireland, that produces graduate engineers capable of working in the competitive environment of world-class manufacturing.Students have the opportunity of studying abroad and have the chance to be chosen for a team which travels to Stanford University and the Silicon Valley area to showcase their product design projects (details below).Graduate skills and career opportunitiesGraduates of the programme will be suited to jobs in the high-tech sector (e.g. computer, aerospace, pharmaceutical, medical devices, electronic) as well as traditional manufacturing (e.g. design, fabrication, assembly). They often work as project managers on teams with design and test engineers, managers, financial controllers, marketing and sales people. The qualification is also well suited to those who wish to pursue careers in project management and management consultancy as well as in the broader business and financial sectors. Past graduates are currently working in DePuySynthes, IBM, Intel, Project Management Group, JP Morgan, Davies Stockbrokers, Pfizer, Jaguar Land Rover, Denis Woods Forensic Engineers, PwC Accountancy, Accenture, and Reckitt Benckiser, and many have gone on to create tech start-up businesses.Your degree and what you’ll studyThe course is structured around themes that are developed over the four years. These themes are: Engineering Fundamentals, Business and Management, Design and Manufacturing Engineering. Approximately 80% of the syllabus comprises engineering subjects such as design, automation, computer simulation/modelling, bio-engineering and materials. The remaining 20% comprises management subjects such as marketing, finance, quality systems, supply chain management, and human resources management. Engineering is a busy but exciting course with typically full days in labs, workshops and lectures, as well as working on team and group projects.A variety of assessment techniques ranging from traditional examinations to continuous assessment, project work, design portfolios is used over the four or five years.Throughout the course, a strong emphasis is placed on group projects, case studies and teamwork. Many of our 4th years are undertaking the 4E5 (Innovation in Product Development) module. This pairs Trinity students in teams with students from the world’s leading universities (e.g. Stanford in the US); each team consisting of 4 students from each university. The course also involves trips to Stanford and the Silicon Valley area. The teams are working with industrial sponsors, recent examples being SAP and Panasonic, with a mission to create innovative solutions to real customer needs.At the end of year three you make a decision to pursue a Bachelor degree (B. Sc.(Ing)) or a Masters degree (M.A.I) depending on achieving the necessary academic standards.Most of our fourth year students are in the first year of a two year masters-cycle leading to the award of an M.A.I degree (see below). Students electing to conclude their studies with a bachelor’s degree (B.Sc. (Ing)) undertake a Capstone project. Those continuing to a fifth year have a number of other options such as the innovation projects (see above), industry-based internships, or study-abroad programmes (see below). Students in fifth year (studying for an M.A.I qualification) undertake a major individual research project and range of advanced specialist technical modules.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Five years Masters in Engineering with study abroad and internship opportunitiesStudents who achieve a satisfactory academic standard in their third year may proceed to a 2-year Master’s cycle, which will lead to the award of an M.A.I (Masters in Engineering) degree. Those students who choose to graduate after four years with the B.Sc. (Ing) degree will require additional qualifications (e.g. further/alternative postgraduate study) to be eligible for professional accreditation with Engineers Ireland.Four principal routes are available:",

        "Overview": "Students have the option of studying either English Studies (Single Honours) or English Literature (Joint Honours).English Literature covers a broad range of literatures written in the English language, from Chaucer to the present day. The aim of the course is to help students acquire a sense of the development of literatures in English over time and space and a rich array of critical techniques and questions. While Joint Honours students study a range of genres, periods and national literatures, the course is less comprehensive than that of the Single Honours programme.If you want to study the whole range of developments in English and related literatures, from their earliest beginnings through to contemporary studies in the language, you would enjoy either English Literature or English Studies. If you are interested in English Literature in conjunction with another field (such as History or Philosophy), Joint Honours is probably the best option for you; conversely, if your primary interest in English, you might consider English Studies.Trinity is ranked 28th in the world for English Language and Literature (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020). Our commitment to small-group teaching means that you will benefit from close personal staff supervision, so that your writing and discussion skills develop.Our English courses have been designed to develop independence of critical thought and the articulation of informed discussion, both oral and written. Much of your work will be undertaken independently, and you will have at your disposal the resources of one of the world’s great libraries, with rich resources in the full range of literature in English.The School of English also co-ordinates many non-syllabus activities, such as lecture series, conferences and symposia, guest lecturers (such as Anne Enright, Paula Meehan, Colm Tóibín and Emma Donoghue) and visiting writers including Richard Ford, the Pulitzer prizewinning author.The School actively supports several journals of creative and critical writing by undergraduates. Many of our students are involved in student societies, where they take part in activities such as journalism, debating and theatre. In this way we ensure that your time studying English at Trinity is exciting and intense.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.Trinity’s School of English graduates gain leading roles in intellectual, professional and public life. The skills developed by students of English are in high demand from employers, especially in journalism, broadcasting, teaching, advertising, marketing and business, arts management, publishing, law and diplomacy. Recent graduates work in Google, the Irish Times, the Department of Foreign Affairs, RTÉ and PwC.The four-year degree provides an outstanding platform for postgraduate study in English, and usually about 30% of our graduates go on to read for a higher degree in English (Master’s degree, Ph.D. degree).Many well-known creative writers are Trinity English graduates, including Eavan Boland, Deirdre Madden, Michael Longley, John Connolly, Derek Mahon, Brendan Kennelly, Anne Enright, Paula Meehan and Sally Rooney.The English courses are designed so that the first year consists of compulsory modules, taught through a combination of lectures and tutorials. In the second year there are further compulsory modules, but you will also take approved modules outside English. In the third and fourth year, students choose between a large number of option modules in English, reflecting the great variety of expertise among the staff.The first and second year provide an introduction to a variety of critical theories, practices and approaches to literature. You will primarily concentrate on selected prescribed texts. Examples of first and second year modules include: Genres, Irish Writing, Imagining the Middle Ages, Shakespeare, Writing Childhoods, Pulp: Introduction to Popular Literature, American Literature, Postcolonial Literature and Imagining the Contemporary.In the third and fourth years, you will choose most of your modules from a wide range of specialist options; in these years, modules are taught at an advanced level in small group seminars. Examples of third and fourth year modules may include: Creative Writing, Ulysses in Context, African and Caribbean Literature, Crime Fiction, Global Shakespeare, Modernism, American Writing, Children’s Literature, Popular Literature, and History of the English Language. All final-year students are expected to complete a Capstone project, which might be a dissertation, a study of material from the Library’s Open Collections, or a portfolio of Creative Writing.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.English Studies is also available within the Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University.Assessment is by a combination of submitted essays, journals, dissertation and end-of-semester examinations. In first and second year the weighting is approximately 66% submitted work and 33% final examinations. In third and fourth year it may vary depending on the modules chosen, although submission of a Capstone project is compulsory for all final year students.Students in the School of English may apply to study abroad during their third year, either on the Erasmus programme in Europe or on a Nono-Eu exchange in a wide range of countries, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, Singapore and China.

        "Overview": "Students have the option of studying either English Studies (Single Honours) or English Literature (Joint Honours).The study of English is concerned with the history and practices of writing in English and encompasses literary works spanning English, Anglo-Irish, American and post-colonial cultures.

        "Overview": "Environmental Science and Engineering is a new integrated undergraduate with postgraduate degree course that aims to train the next generation of graduates who have the competencies, knowledge and experience necessary to design and deploy solutions that protect and improve our environment and human wellbeing, and that work with rather than against the natural world to foster biodiversity, climate action and sustainable use of Earth’s finite resourcesStudents complete an integrated five-year course consisting of four year B.Sc. plus an additional year of study leading to either Master in Engineering (Studies) a M.A.I. (St.) or Master in Applied Environmental Science MAES.The course will provide students with fundamental grounding in the natural sciences and engineering, and in the applied skills required to develop sustainable solutions for major societal and environmental challenges. The unique combination of engineering and natural sciences modules represents one of the first in Ireland and internationally. Strong emphasis is placed on students acquiring practical laboratory and field skills, as well as working in teams.This new integrated degree programme is delivered through the expertise of two Schools (School of Natural Science and the School of Engineering).The School of Natural Sciences conducts research, and delivers teaching, on all aspects of the natural world, from the formation of the earth, the behaviour of the environment, the evolution and ecology of its organisms and its interactions with human society.Trinity’s School of Engineering is ranked in the top 100 engineering schools in the world and offers outstanding teaching by Engineers who are at the forefront of their field worldwide. The School of Engineering is a vibrant, intellectual community of innovative researchers, teachers and students, which combines high-quality teaching with expansive research activity.Environmental Engineers and Applied Environmental Scientists who graduate from this new interdisciplinary programme will address some of the most challenging and important issues of our time in terms of sustainable development, particularly with respect to the protection of the environment. Graduates will have a strong grounding in Environmental Science in conjunction with applied Engineering skills and problem solving approaches and will therefore be at the forefront of initiatives to solve the challenges of many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.Graduates from this programme will be highly skilled and employable in both industrial and governmental organisations both here in Ireland as well as overseas. Recent graduates from the Civil Engineering stream who have specialised in Environmental Engineering are working in R&D, Civil Engineering and Environmental Consultancies, Project Engineers, Environmental Regulation, Energy companies, mining companies as well as setting up new ventures and spin outs.Our environmental engineers and scientist graduates are also working in the design and development of environmental solutions with leading engineering consultancies such as Arup, RPS, ESB International, Shell, IBM etc. Such companies have a strong demand for high quality graduates at the Masters (and Ph.D.) level due to the high technical level off their work. Environmental Engineers and scientists also find employment in governmental regulatory organisations and other institutions such as Local Authorities, Environmental Protection Agency, Geological Survey Ireland, Teagsac as well in Humanitarian Non-Governmental Organisations (Concern, GOAL, Selfhelp Africa).Drawing on the expertise of the School of Engineering and the School of Natural Science at Trinity, this programme focuses on delivering a research-inspired, outcome-based educational experience to students.Students complete an integrated five-year course consisting of four year B.Sc. plus an additional year of study leading to a M.A.I. (St.) or MAES. During the first three years a balanced and integrated programme of modules in environmental science and engineering is provided.Following completion of the first three years of the course, students start to follow a more specialised programme in one of the following strands, although there is still many shared courses and projects between the two strands:Environmental EngineeringThis strand of the Environmental Science and Engineering course places stronger emphasis on modules and project work with an engineering focus in years 4 and 5.Applied Environmental ScienceThis strand of the Environmental Science and Engineering course places stronger emphasis on modules and project work in the discipline of environmental sciences in years 4 and 5.In Year 4, students have the option to undertake an Industry Internship or International Exchange in their chosen stream. These options include Erasmus, UNITECH (as a paid industrial partnership) and CLUSTER. Alternatively, a student can stay for the full year in Trinity and undertake a Capstone Project module which aligns with their chosen stream, in addition to at least 2 optional modules associated with their chosen stream. Following completion of the fourth year of the environmental science and engineering degree course it is anticipated that most eligible students would elect to complete one further year of study in their chosen strand leading to a M.A.I. (St.) or MAES degree.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.AssessmentThis new course will be delivered through laboratory practicals, lectures and field work which includes international trips. The course has been designed to embed a diverse array of assessment approaches across the entire 5 year programme. These include summative and formative assessment approaches, peer assessment, group assessment, self- assessment and more conventional continuous and exam assessment methods.Students who spend the first semester of fourth year in Trinity may then spend the second semester on an industrial placement where they complete an industry-based project. Students following this mode will have two project supervisors: a staff member of the host company, to provide day-to- day guidance whilst on placement as well as liaison with Trinity and a member of Trinity’s academic staff. Alternatively, students who have chosen the Environmental Engineering route may opt to spend the fourth year on the Cluster/Unitech programme in a partner University, or on an Erasmus exchange as per existing M.A.I. (St.).Students who have chosen the Applied Environmental Science route may opt to spend the fourth year on an Erasmus exchange. The Erasmus programme will build on a current shared programme run by the Schools of Natural Sciences and Engineering.Due to the multi-disciplinary, inter-school nature of the course with its essential foundation courses in both natural sciences and engineering taken in the freshman years, we are not in a position to consider applications for Advanced entry to the Environmental Science and Engineering course.",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Environmental Sciences for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Environmental Sciences as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Environmental Sciences is by its nature a multidisciplinary academic field, comprising a study of the frequently complex interactions between the biological, chemical and physical components of our environment. The environmental science discipline has evolved over the last numbers of decades as key environmental problems such as climate change, air, water and soil pollution, sustainable development, deforestation, desertification and urbanisation to name a few, have become the focus of scientists, policy makers and the general public. Environmental scientists have training that is similar to other physical or life scientists, but is specifically applied to the environment. A broad scientific knowledge is required which involves a fundamental understanding of the physical and life sciences in addition to mathematics, economics, law and the social sciences.If you are interested in developing the skills required to safeguard the future of the planet through monitoring, protecting, conserving and sustainably managing the environment, then this is the course for you. The undergraduate degree course offered by the School of Natural Sciences has been designed to provide for the needs of students with an interest in this rapidly developing academic and professional field. Environmental Sciences at Trinity is a multidisciplinary programme with cross-discipline contributions from the Trinity Centre for the Environment and the disciplines of Botany, Engineering, Geography, Geology and Zoology. The course is delivered through small-group teaching, lectures, tutorials, laboratory classes and field study, and these approaches are blended with the theoretical content to provide our graduates with the training required to become highly successful practitioners in this field. Fieldwork is a core component of the course structure, and students have the opportunity to attend a range of residential field excursions around Ireland as well as in the Canary Islands and Kenya. The staff that contribute to this course are all research active and are addressing key issues in Environmental Sciences across temperate, tropical and polar systems. .As a graduate in this area you will be able to take advantage of the worldwide demand generated by increasing environmental awareness. Our graduates pursue careers in conservation, resource management, waste management, environmental research, environmental protection, policy development and environmental education.Many graduates move straight into environmental consultancy, while others find employment in NGO’s, national and local government departments, monitoring agencies, conservation bodies and analytical laboratories. It is also common for a number of our graduates to choose to further their education by pursuing postgraduate degrees in Environmental Science and related fields. .Mandatory modules:Optional modules:Students will also have the opportunity to take up to two modules from the Trinity Electives (www.tcd.ie/trinity-electives/electives).

        "Overview": "This module explores the political and cultural history of Europe during the early modern period. It analyses the efforts of reformers to revive their churches and societies during the sixteenth century. It then examines the legacy of these reform movements and considers how cultural divisions as well as competition for power led to prolonged periods of conflict within states and between states during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This module then charts the emergence during the eighteenth century of new ways of thinking about private life and popular culture and of new ideas about science, society and the self of the Enlightenment. Finally, it explores how these ideas contributed to political crisis following the French Revolution.Lecturers: Dr Graeme Murdock; Dr Joseph Clarke How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ in December for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.

        "Overview": "European Studies is a broad-ranging and integrated programme that offers students the chance to learn European languages, and also to study history and social sciences. This programme encourages students to think about our continent in all its complexity, and to analyse Europe’s cultures, history, and politics.If you care about Europe’s past and future, if you enjoy studying languages, and have an interest in history, politics, and the workings of contemporary society you will enjoy this course. European Studies is designed for students with a broad intellectual appetite, and who are interested in a range of disciplines and subjects.European Studies at Trinity offers a unique and broad range of languages and subjects to study, and draws on the expertise and dedication of lecturers from a wide range of disciplines. Staff from different departments work together to deliver a fully-integrated programme that offers flexibility and choice for students. European Studies attracts students with strong potential from Ireland and abroad.The language skills and understanding of a variety of disciplines gained through European Studies allow our graduates to take up opportunities in a diverse range of careers. Recent graduates are employed in international organisations both in Ireland and abroad, in the EU, in the civil service and the diplomatic corps, in business, finance and marketing. Other popular career paths are in consultancy, teaching (in Ireland and abroad), translating and interpreting, journalism and tourism. Many students go on to do postgraduate courses.You will study two out of five available European languages: Spanish, French, German, Italian, Polish, or Russian (German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and Russian can be studied from beginner level). Both languages are studied equally in the first two years, after which one becomes your Major, and the other your Minor language. As well as languages, you will study European history, the history of ideas, and social sciences (politics, economics, or sociology).In first year, you will study two chosen languages, the history of early modern Europe, an introductory module to the history of ideas, and you will take one introductory module in the social sciences (political science, sociology or economics). In second year, you will continue to study two languages, study the history of Europe in the 20th Century, the history of ideas during the period of Enlightenment and Romanticism, and will choose from further options in history, politics, sociology, or economics.The third year is spent at a university abroad studying through the language you choose as your Major language. In the final year, language work focuses on your Major language while coursework for your Minor language concentrates mainly on comprehension and textual analysis. The core course in your final year is called ‘Modernity and Society: Ideas and Culture in Europe since 1850’. Additionally, you will choose options from a wide range of modules from history, political science, sociology, economics and a number of culture and literature options from the language departments.At all levels, you will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of traditional and innovative continuous assessment methods: essays, project work, presentations, podcast creation. Language modules are traditionally assessed by written, oral and aural examinations. Final year students also write a Capstone project.This degree is also available within the Dual B.A. Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Learning languages?Studying Europe’s past?Thinking about the current state of Europe?A year or semester studying abroad is one of the highlights of a student’s Trinity experience, and immersing oneself in the language and culture is also one of the most valuable ways of achieving fluency when you are studying a language. European students spend third year of study abroad in one of our partner universities.Exchanges have been established with history and political science departments in universities in France (Paris, Strasbourg, Grenoble, and Bordeaux), Germany (Hamburg, Tübingen, Freiburg), Austria (Vienna), Spain ( Salamanca, Seville, Zaragoza and Alcala de Henares), Italy (Pavia, Siena and Milan), Poland (Kraków) and Russia (Moscow). The year abroad may entail additional expenses for students but support funding under the European Union’s Erasmus scheme partially offsets this (with the exception of Russia, outside the Erasmus scheme).Two BA Honours Bachelor Degrees (NFQ Level 8) Degrees awarded by Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin and Columbia UniversityThe Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University offers students a unique opportunity to earn two BA degrees while spending the first two years at Trinity and years three and four at Columbia University in New York.This course is for those interested in expanding their experience to gain a truly international education. Students in the Dual BA Programme graduate with two BA degrees, one from Trinity and one from Columbia. After the first two years in Trinity, students then spend a further two years at Columbia, where they fulfil the requirements for one of the approved majors while also completing Columbia’s core curriculum. Students also undertake additional study to meet the requirements of the Trinity BA, including a Capstone project.At Trinity, alongside modules in the social sciences, modern European history, and the History of Ideas, students choose two languages from French, German, Italian, Irish, Polish, Russian, and Spanish. French and Irish are not offered at a beginner level; no student may study more than one language as a beginner. At Columbia, students choose one of seven majors: History; Political Science; Hispanic Studies; French; German Literature and Cultural History; Italian; or Slavic Studies. Students opt for a period of study abroad in Europe, an internship or a multidisciplinary-taught module.Applicants to the Dual BA Programme must apply by 2nd January 2022 for September 2022 entry. The admissions process includes a review of the applicant’s academic history, letters of recommendation, an essay, and an interview conducted in English. Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) can be submitted but are not required for 2022 entry. Applications are reviewed by a joint committee with representatives from both Institutions. EU applicants to the Dual BA Programme must also apply to and receive an offer from their chosen programme at Trinity through the Central Applications Office (CAO).GET IN TOUCH!Further information and contact details:www.tcd.gs.columbia.eduE columbiadualba@tcd.ie ",

        "Overview": "French is a major world language, with a rich cultural and intellectual heritage. Knowledge of the French language and its literature and culture opens up a world of opportunities to those who study them. French is an official working language of many international organisations (UN, OECD, NATO, etc.) and plays a decisive role in world affairs. In 2018, Ireland became an observer member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the international cultural and economic cooperation body for the French-speaking world, thereby recognising the importance of French in the post-Brexit EU and the economic possibilities that exist beyond the English-speaking world.If you are fascinated by how other languages and cultures offer a different perspective on the world, French at Trinity could well be the course for you. You will enjoy studying French here if you have a passion for novels, cinema, drama, poetry, literature in all its forms – and if you want to develop your ability to think critically. If you are interested in French and European history, politics and thought, and if you would like to experience French culture first-hand by living and studying in France, then Trinity’s Joint Honours degree programmes in French are for you.French at Trinity is a four year course providing a breadth and depth of experience that puts our graduates among the most highly qualified in the field. All students are encouraged to go abroad for a full academic year, or a term. There is no better way to learn French than to live and study through the language (see Study Abroad section).Trinity French graduates are working for Google, eBay, Christian Louboutin, The Abbey Theatre, Amazon, the British Institute in Florence, the Museum of Modern Art in New York or the Centre Culturel Irlandais in Paris. Recent graduates are working in areas as diverse as arts administration, translation and interpreting, diplomacy, tourism, publishing, and investment banking, as well as second-level teaching and the Civil Service. Many go on to take postgraduate courses in areas such as law, marketing and business for which a degree in arts and humanities provides an ideal background. The combination of an arts degree and a more vocational or professional programme of studies has proved to be highly attractive to prospective employers.Do you enjoy…At entry, French must be combined with one other subject. In later years you will be able to select additional subjects and electives.The development of reading, analytical, and critical skills, through both oral and written exercises in French, form the bedrock of this course. A range of optional subjects are available over the course of the four years.The programme in first year includes an introduction to French language, literature, and history. First year subject areas include: (i) French grammar and grammatical analysis, (ii) written and oral comprehension and (iii) modern fiction, theatre, cinema and poetry. You will spend four contact hours each week working on French language and grammar, and three studying literature and contemporary French and francophone history and society. In second year, you will build on this foundation by following courses in the history of French ideas and politics, French literature, French linguistics and in the practice of the French language itself.In third and fourth year, a wide variety of optional modules building on courses previously undertaken are available. These range from Renaissance and Enlightenment writing to Romantic and Modern French literature; from French language, politics, society and identity to French critical theory, philosophy, history and cinema. In your final year, you will research and write a Capstone project in English or French on a subject of your choice in consultation with a supervisor.At all levels, you will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of traditional and innovative continuous assessment methods – essays, project work, online grammar tests, presentations, book reviews and dossiers, podcast creation.Language modules are traditionally assessed by written, oral and aural examinations.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.A year or semester studying abroad is one of the highlights of a student’s Trinity experience, and immersing oneself in the language and culture is also one of the most valuable ways of achieving fluency when you are studying a language. Single Honours students have a compulsory third year of study abroad and other students are encouraged to spend a year or a semester in their third year in one of our partner universities. At a minimum, you will be required to spend two months in a French speaking country prior to taking your final exams. We currently have exchange agreements with Paris 3 – Sorbonne Nouvelle, Lyon 2, Bordeaux-Montaigne and Orléans universities.",

        "Overview": "'The story is no longer about the things that have happened to women and men and how they have reacted to them; instead it is about how the subjective and collective meanings of women and men as categories of identity have been constructed.’ (Joan Scott, Gender and the Politics of History, New York, 19988, p.6). This lecture-only module will examine the histories and representations of gender, seeking to understand how gender is constructed by societies, institutions and individuals, through the critical analysis of texts, works of art and public actions. Gender, its role, its construction and it historiography will be brought together by scholars across the school in an interdisciplinary module. The operation of gender ‘as a tool of analysis’ will be examined in histories of the body, sexuality, medicine, religion, politics, institutions and representations in a variety of texts and contexts which will show the inherent instability and elusive nature of many gendered identities.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Genetics for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Genetics as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Genetics is the study of genes, genomes and heredity. It has developed rapidly in the last decade as new technology has made it possible to study genes in much greater detail and to rapidly sequence genomes.A few examples of remarkable advances in knowledge include:If you are interested in understanding the principles of inheritance; how genetic mechanisms control different developmental and physiological processes in biology; and how a perturbation of these mechanisms leads to disorders and diseases, this is the right course for you.Genetics is run by the Department of Genetics, which is part of the School of Genetics and Microbiology and is located in the Smurfit Institute of Genetics with state-of-the-art research facilities. There are 14 members of faculty and a number of academic associates, working in a wide range of areas of genetics areas covering everything from medical genetics, pharmacogenomics, neurogenetics, stem cells to evolutionary genetics and plant genetics, amongst other areas. The Department of Genetics has an international reputation for high-quality research and more than 50 years of experience in teaching Genetics to undergraduate students. The teaching of the Department is research-driven; undergraduates are taught by research-active scientists with excellent track records in their chosen fields.Many Genetics graduates go on to higher degrees (M.Sc. and/or PhD) and take up careers in research in either academia or industry. Opportunities exist in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, agricultural organisations, medical or clinical diagnostic laboratories, forensics, public health and epidemiology programmes, and in teaching. Other graduates have gone into careers such as medicine, patent law or science journalism. Even if you choose a career not directly related to the scientific subject, the skills of critical thinking and problem solving provided by the Genetics degree will put you in high demand.During third year, students will learn about the fundamentals of genetics through a combination of lecture courses and practical classes. In fourth year, students can choose, largely depending on their interests, from a number of lecture courses on different areas of genetics. They also spend 10 to 12 weeks in a laboratory of the institute and participate in ongoing research projects. They further write an in-depth literature review on a current topic of genetics.

        "Overview": "Geography is a discipline inherently suited to addressing current and future societal challenges. It asks questions about how and why human, physical, and environmental phenomena vary across space and time. Geography is intrinsically interdisciplinary and, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, geographers are well placed to bring their understanding and skills to bear on social and environmental issues.Today, geographical knowledge and experience are more important than ever, helping us to understand a dynamic and rapidly changing world. Our staff are world leaders in their chosen field and bring that expertise to their teaching. You will get to study in the classroom and the field, and undertake independent research in Ireland, overseas and even on Mars!Trinity is continually ranked in the world top 100 universities for geography and is a hub of intensive and extensive geographical scholarship in Ireland (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020). We teach and research across the subject, from coastal modelling and environmental change to development theory and urbanisation. Trinity geographers provide expert advice to governments and non-government institutions alike, on issues such as climate change, the economy, social inequality, health and wellbeing.Geographers are trained to analyse and provide solutions to diverse global challenges, ranging from the environmental and the urban, to the economic, political and social. This combination of subject specific (e.g. GIS, remote sensing, modelling) and transferable skills (e.g. teamwork, problem solving) make geography graduates highly valued in today’s job market, where adaptability and flexibility are widely regarded as assets.Careers taken up by graduating geography students include urban and regional planning, environmental consultancy, research and teaching, financial services, foreign affairs, leisure, tourism and overseas development.The first year Geography course aims to provide a solid grounding in human, physical and environmental geography, focusing on materials that are dealt with in greater depth in later years.

        "Overview": "Geography and Geoscience is the study of our planet and the people that live on it. This multi-disciplinary programme is designed by leading research scientists in response to critical challenges facing the Earth system and humanity in the 21st century. It integrates knowledge from the physical, chemical, biological and social sciences to develop novel insights into Earth system function and human-environment interactions. So, if you are interested in studying the dynamics of our planet, understanding environmental changes past, present and future, and learning how to manage Earth’s resources in an economic and sustainable manner, we have the degree for you.The Geography and Geoscience degree programme is the Science entry pathway for the study of geography (human and physical geography) and geoscience (geology and physical geography) at Trinity. Our four-year programmes, culminating in the degrees of Geography or Geoscience, combine classroom lectures, seminars, laboratory-based practical classes, and outdoor field work, to develop the theoretical understanding and technical expertise needed to address applied, real-world problems such as natural resource management and sea level rise.In first and second year you will acquire a broad grounding in geography and geoscience with an emphasis on physical geography, geology and human-environment interactions. You will learn about topical issues such as climate change, natural hazards (e.g. volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides), energy, sustainability and natural resources. These foundation years cover a diverse range of material including: the origins and development of our planet; earth structure and composition; circulation in the atmosphere and oceans; the evolution of life on Earth; Earth surface processes and environments (e.g. glaciers, rivers and deserts). In addition to learning about the physical, chemical and biological processes responsible for creating and shaping the Earth, students will also consider the unique role that humans play in the Earth system, including their impacts on the land, air and water, and the grand challenges linked to environmental governance, policy and management.In third and fourth year, you will deepen your knowledge in specialist areas, while further developing a portfolio of practical and technical skills (e.g. geochemical analysis, geographical information systems). Our flexible programme structure provides for module choice while retaining coherent curriculum design, thereby ensuring graduates are well prepared for entry to the constantly changing job market. Specialist options span the breadth of Geography and Geoscience, allowing you to tailor the course to suit your interests. In this way, you may focus on topics traditionally associated with geography (e.g. geomorphology, globalisation, sustainability) or geology (e.g. volcanology, palaeontology, earth resources), or you may choose to retain a broader, multi-disciplinary perspective that spans the critical interface between science and society.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Geography and geoscience graduates are highly valued for their cross-disciplinary expertise, adaptability and experience of dealing with complex spatial or multivariate data sets. They are in demand to work on many of society’s most important challenges, and can pursue lucrative and personally rewarding careers in industry, academia, research and government. Careers leading directly from the programme include work in: environmental, engineering and geological consultancies; mineral exploration companies; the hydrocarbon industry; environmental planning; overseas development; government geological surveys; teaching and research.

        "Overview": "Geography is a discipline inherently suited to addressing current and future societal challenges. It asks questions about how and why human, physical, and environmental phenomena vary across space and time. Geography is intrinsically interdisciplinary and, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, geographers are well placed to bring their understanding and skills to bear on social and environmental issues.Today, geographical knowledge and experience are more important than ever, helping us to understand a dynamic and rapidly changing world. Our staff are world leaders in their chosen field and bring that expertise to their teaching. You will get to study in the classroom and the field, and undertake independent research in Ireland, overseas and even on Mars!Trinity is continually ranked in the world top 100 universities for geography and is a hub of intensive and extensive geographical scholarship in Ireland (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020). We teach and research across the subject, from coastal modelling and environmental change to development theory and urbanisation. Trinity geographers provide expert advice to governments and non-government institutions alike, on issues such as climate change, the economy, social inequality, health and wellbeing.Geographers are trained to analyse and provide solutions to diverse global challenges, ranging from the environmental and the urban, to the economic, political and social. This combination of subject specific (e.g. GIS, remote sensing, modelling) and transferable skills (e.g. teamwork, problem solving) make geography graduates highly valued in today’s job market, where adaptability and flexibility are widely regarded as assets. Careers taken up by graduating geography students include urban and regional planning, environmental consultancy, research and teaching, financial services, foreign affairs, leisure, tourism and overseas development.The first two years provide a solid grounding in geography. You will take core modules covering physical and human geography, geology and environmental processes, along with foundation modules in mathematics, statistics and computation. You will tailor your experience by selecting optional modules drawn from among the chemical, physical and biological sciences, and human geography.In third and fourth year you will deepen your knowledge in particular aspects of geography, whilst further developing your portfolio of practical and technical skills. You will take part in a residential field course and learn techniques and skills that can lay the foundations for carrying out an individual research project (dissertation). Topics covered during third and fourth years include climate and environmental change, geomorphology, environmental governance, urban geography, globalisation and development, GIS and remote sensing.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.There are opportunities for students to spend all or part of the third year studying abroad at Exeter, Bordeaux, Paris-Sorbonne, Prague (Charles University), Utrecht or Stockholm universities.",

        "Overview": "German is spoken by some 100 million Europeans. To study German at an in-depth level is to order your very own passport to possibility. Not alone will you be highly employable in Ireland, the EU and further afield, you will also see the world around you differently.English may be the language of Shakespeare, but German is the language of Freud and Marx and some of the most influential ideas of our own time. The German-speaking world has produced thinkers, artists and innovators of astonishing brilliance and impact. It also inflicted on Europe the most evil regime it has ever seen—followed by the most profound reflection on that awful fact. All of this makes German a fascinating language to learn and a fascinating degree subject to study.We teach most of our language and culture modules in small groups, which is a real advantage for the language learner and sets us apart from most other universities in Ireland and further afield.Whether you are a beginner or have completed German to post-Leaving Certificate (or equivalent), with us you will acquire advanced competence and fluency, spoken and written, in the German language. You will also develop reading and communication skills alongside methods of research and analysis in literature, history, culture, film, and society of the German speaking countries.If you are interested in stretching your horizons, habits and hopes; if you are curious about the relationship between who we are and how we speak; if you want to understand the magic that can happen when cultures meet; if you consider literature, film and history all part of our human make-up... then a German degree at Trinity could be just for you.We offer a wide range of modules in written and spoken language, in literature, culture and ideas. We teach in small groups and we offer both beginners and post-school-leaving programmes.Being a small Department has given us a strongly student-centred ethos. We get to know all our students and do everything we can to help each and every one of them thrive in their studies. Each undergraduate student is an individual whose talent and potential it is our privilege to nurture.Employers value the language skills of German graduates, and their ‘transferable skills’: the creativity, confidence, and sensitivity which marks the advanced linguist, the maturity and flexibility that comes from engaging with another culture, and from experience gained abroad. Recent graduates work for Google, Deutsche Bank, and Enterprise Ireland, also in telecoms, IT, education, public service, the media, law, and in universities in Ireland, Europe, and North America.Do you enjoy…At entry, German must be combined with one other subject. In later years, depending on your pathway, you may select to take modules in related disciplines and electives.Throughout your degree, you will have an average of 7 tuition hours per week. The course covers three key areas:In second year, in addition to language classes, you take seminars with a literary, filmic, cultural or historical focus. These can include seminars on the phenomenon of National Socialism, Hitler, German-Jewish literary and cultural history, and themes from 20th century German and Austrian literature.In third year, students on the Single Honours pathway in German will study abroad. Other students of German are also encouraged to study abroad. If you stay in Dublin, alongside your language classes you will choose from modules in German intellectual history, culture and literature from the 19th century to the present, as well as on research and writing skills for the Capstone Project.In fourth year, these specialist interests are extended through advanced options that link undergraduate study to staff research expertise.You will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of continuous assessment methods – essays, project work, presentations, and journals. Language modules are assessed by written, oral and aural examinations. Final year students also write a Capstone project.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.A year or semester studying abroad is a highlight of a German student’s Trinity experience. Immersing oneself in the language and culture is one of the most valuable ways of achieving fluency when you are studying a language. Single Honours students have a compulsory third year of study abroad and other students are encouraged to spend a year or a semester abroad also. At a minimum, you will be required to spend two months in a German-speaking country prior to taking your final exams. We currently have exchange agreements with Cologne, Göttingen, Konstanz, and Vienna universities",

        "Overview": "This innovative and successful programme, run by the Trinity Centre for Global Health, aims to provide graduates with a greater appreciation of the global interconnectedness of healthproblems and to equip them with a range of analytical and methodological skills to address the challenges of global health. Designed for individuals from a wide range of disciplines and professions, the programme adopts a multidisciplinary approach that integrates health and social science perspectives to analyse, design, implement and evaluate health programmes within a global context.Global health is an attempt to address health problems and issues that transcend national boundaries, and are informed by the circumstances and experiences of countries in differingcontexts. The underlying assumption is that the world’s health problems are shared and are best tackled by cooperative action and the sharing of innovative solutions.The MSc in Global Health augments traditional approaches to public and international health by bringing together perspectives and insights from a range of health and social sciencesin understanding and resolving the challenges of global health. These problems may arise, for example, in relief and development programmes in developing countries; in conflict and post-conflict situations; with refugees, asylum seekers and economic migrants; with tourists and business travellers. All countries give rise to inequities in health, wealth, education and human rights, and the interconnectedness of these issues will be a major theme running throughout the course.The course also lays emphasis on ‘local' experiences that resonates globally in the case of Ireland. These include the influence of poverty and rapid social change on health and identityin Ireland; migration and refugee welfare, the consequences of ethnic conflict, the peace process and the challenges of reconciliation for creating inclusive health services. The strongest emphasis within the course is on health equity both within and between countries.Graduates pursued leadership positions in global health research, policy and practice, among a variety of other fields related to global health issues.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "History is about people. Studying History means studying lives, events and ideas in times and places often very different from our own. History embraces everything from the rise and fall of empires, or the birth of new ideologies, to the contrasting everyday lives of people in a whole range of settings, across time and across the globe. Studying History means developing critical skills, learning to express your ideas and arguments clearly, and becoming self-directed in your studies.History is a subject for the intellectually curious. It offers an enormous diversity of subjects to explore, questions to ponder and problems to resolve. The History modules at Trinity allow you to study a remarkable range of types of history – whether cultural or political history, military or social history, environmental history or the history of ideas – from the early Middle Ages to the very recent past. We offer survey modules allowing you to grasp the broad patterns in history, specialist modules where you can study topics of particular interest to you in small classes, and opportunities for you to pursue your own independent research.The History Department at Trinity offers a remarkably broad range of discipline options for its size. The four-year programme allows students to lay firm foundations in the first two years, with wide-ranging modules on medieval and modern history, Irish, European, American, environmental and global history, as well as on historical methods and approaches. The final two years of the programme allow students the chance to study several specialist modules in-depth and to undertake independent research on a subject of their own choice. The breadth and depth of study in this programme is unique in Ireland and has few rivals internationally. Trinity is a leading university internationally for the study of History. Our staff has published extensively in the fields of Irish, British, European and American history. We take special pride in the small-group teaching which characterises the final two years of study in particular, and for being a department which places student learning at the centre of its values. The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.Over many decades History graduates (Single Honours and Joint Honours) have pursued successful careers in a wide range of areas. These include: accountancy, advertising, banking, broadcasting, arts and heritage administration, human resources, journalism, law, public administration, public relations, management, marketing, publishing and teaching. Our graduates work for such organisations as the Irish Times, the Law Society of Ireland, Oxfam, IBEC, the American Chamber of Commerce, RTÉ, Google, the United Nations and Accenture. The diversity of careers reflects the wide array of skills amassed by students undertaking a degree in History at Trinity.The History programme combines the strength of a broad-based programme in the first two years, introducing all students to the sheer diversity of historical studies, with the freedom to explore areas of particular interest to individual students in the final two years.The first and second years provide a range of modules covering medieval and modern periods, including Irish, European, and American history, as well as some modules exploring the skills and methods which historians use, and the kinds of debates in which historians engage. Teaching is not only in lectures but in small group tutorials.All students will have an opportunity to undertake a group project in their second year, undertaking research as a team. The third and fourth years offer a wide range of choice in more specialist modules, all taught by staff with expertise in that field.There is the opportunity to concentrate on those parts of history which interest you most in the final year Capstone project, an independent project which many students find the most rewarding part of their degree programme.Single Honours students take modules in Medieval and Early Modern Irish and European history in first year, as well as modules to introduce the methods and approaches historians use in their studies. In second year, students take modules in Modern Irish and Modern European History, in U.S. History and in Global History.They also take modules exploring how history has been interpreted and presented, not just by professional historians but within popular culture, and they take part in a year-long small group project. Joint Honours students also take part in the group project in second year, and select from the period-specific modules to make up the History component of their studies.We offer a range of topics within two different categories:List I (Special Subject) modules: These are specialist modules which involve intensive research and writing based on primary sources. Some examples include:List II modules: These are broader thematic and analytical modules. Some will have a particular focus on historiography; on how different historians have tried to understand a period or problem.Some examples include:In any given year there will be a variety of types of history on offer – including political, social, cultural, environmental or intellectual history – ranging in time from Early Medieval Ireland to the post 1945 world, and including Irish, European, American and Asian history modules.For full details on all our modules see:https://www.tcd.ie/history/undergraduate/ Students are assessed through both examinations and coursework in each year of the programme. In third and fourth year, the balance is approximately 50% exams and 50% continuous assessment.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.This degree is also available within the Dual B.A. Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University. The Department of History has Erasmus exchange agreements with a wide range of European universities including the Sorbonne (Paris), the University of Vienna and Charles University in Prague. The Department also has an exchange agreement with the University of Tokyo, and students of History can also arrange for a year abroad in other countries, notably the U.S.A., Australia and Canada, where some recent examples would include the University of California, the University of Sydney or McGill University (Montreal).Two BA Honours Bachelor Degrees (NFQ Level 8) Degrees awarded by Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin and Columbia UniversityThe Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University offers students a unique opportunity to earn two BA degrees while spending the first two years at Trinity and years three and four at Columbia University in New York.This course is for those interested in expanding their experience to gain a truly international education. Students in the Dual BA Programme graduate with two BA degrees, one from Trinity and one from Columbia. After the first two years in Trinity, students then spend a further two years at Columbia, where they fulfil the requirements for one of the approved majors while also completing Columbia’s core curriculum. Students also undertake additional study to meet the requirements of the Trinity BA, including a Capstone project.At Trinity students are introduced to advanced historical study through modules that focus on periods ranging from the medieval to the contemporary. History is studied alongside other disciplines, including the social sciences and languages. Columbia’s comprehensive History curriculum in years three and four complements students’ time in Dublin, covering most areas of the world and most periods of history. Students also complete a Capstone essay in their final year. Applicants to the Dual BA Programme must apply by 2nd January 2022 for September 2022 entry. The admissions process includes a review of the applicant’s academic history, letters of recommendation, an essay, and an interview conducted in English. Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) can be submitted but are not required for 2022 entry. Applications are reviewed by a joint committee with representatives from both Institutions. EU applicants to the Dual BA Programme must also apply to and receive an offer from their chosen programme at Trinity through the Central Applications Office (CAO).GET IN TOUCH!Further information and contact details:www.tcd.gs.columbia.eduE columbiadualba@tcd.ie",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Human Genetics for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Human Genetics as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Human genetics is the study of genes – or heredity – in humans. It examines the effects of these genes on both individuals and societies. It has developed rapidly in the last decade as new technologies have made it possible to study genes in much greater detail, to rapidly sequence the genomes of humans and other species and to develop ways to correct disease causing mutations using powerful technologies such as genome editing. A few examples of remarkable advances in knowledge include:If you are interested in understanding how genetics is central to controlling every cell and its functions including the 30-40 trillion cells in the human body, to directing intricate programmes of development and to causing many different disorders when perturbed, this is the right course for you. If you want to understand how genetic information is driving the development of novel therapies, is enabling the individualisation of medicines targeted towards patients’ needs, is revealing our ancestries and how it underpins evolutionary biology, this is the degree for you.Human Genetics is run by the Department of Genetics, which is part of the School of Genetics and Microbiology and is located in the Smurfit Institute of Genetics with state-of-the-art research facilities. There are 12 members of faculty and a number of academic associates, working in a wide range of areas of Human Genetics covering everything from medical genetics, gene based medicines, pharmacogenomics, stem cells to ancient and modern human population genetics, amongst other areas. The Department of Genetics has an international reputation for high-quality research and more than 50 years of experience in teaching Genetics and Human Genetics to undergraduate students. The teaching of the Department is research driven; undergraduates are taught by research-active scientists with excellent track records in their chosen fields.Many Human Genetics graduates go on to higher degrees (M.Sc. and/or Ph.D.) and take up careers in research in either academia or industry. Opportunities exist in biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, medical or clinical diagnostic laboratories, forensics, public health and epidemiology programmes, and in teaching.Genetic counselling is a rapidly expanding field that might also interest you. Other graduates have gone into careers such as medicine, patent law or science journalism. Even if you choose a career not directly related to the scientific subject, the skills of critical thinking and problem solving provided by the Human Genetics degree will put you in high demand.During third year, students will learn about the fundamentals of Human Genetics through a combination of lecture courses and practical classes. To this end, students will be exposed to different areas of Human Genetics ranging from medical genetics to the genetic programmes underpinning cell biology. Practical classes teach students about key techniques and analysis methods that are widely used in Human Genetics. In fourth year, students can choose, largely depending on their interests, from various lecture courses in different areas of Human Genetics. Students spend 10 to 12 weeks in a laboratory in the Institute and participate in on-going cutting edge research projects. Furthermore students write an in-depth literature review on a current topic inSubjects include: Medical Genetics, Pharmacogenomics, Eukaryotic Molecular Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology, Neurogenetics Evolutionary Genetics, Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Analytical Genetics Laboratory, Human Genomics Data Handling, Human Genetics tutorials, Human Genetics Review.Human Genetics literature review; Human Genetics Capstone research project; Lecture topics including Principles of Human Genetics, Transgenic Animals and Gene Therapy, Genetics and Epigenetics of Cancer, Prion-Like Proteins, Apoptosis, Stem Cell Biology, Molecular Evolution; Genetics and Immunology of Neural Diseases, Human Evolutionary Genetics, Genetics of Neural Development, Behavioural Genetics.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Students will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and end-of-semester examinations.The Department helps students to secure internships in research laboratories (both in Ireland and internationally) over the summer period between the third and fourth years, so that they can gain valuable research experience. Some students spend all or part of the summer period in US laboratories, again between third and fourth year.Students who wish to study Human Genetics apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (TR060) and may select Human Genetics as their specialist area for the third and fourth years at the end of the second year.",

        "Overview": "The Human Health and Disease degree trains students for work in the field of biomedical research.It brings to life the fascinating connections between structure and function in the human body and explores the health and disease continuum in detail, including teaching on how medical therapies act to treat or even prevent disease. As an example, understanding brain structure and biochemistry allows us to appreciate how neurons communicate and this in turn is helping biomedical researchers and clinicians to identify new and effective ways to treat and prevent diseases such as dementia.A central feature of the learning experience is the development of a core set of real-life, transferable skills in the following areas: laboratory technique, group project work, data analysis, public presentation, report writing, research methodology and critical thinking.This course will suit you if you are interested in human biology and want to gain an in-depth, scientific understanding of the structure and function of the human body in health; the signs and symptoms of disease; the molecular basis of disease and cutting edge therapeutics in treating disease.Biomedical research is a fast-paced discipline and our course delivers an up-to-date appreciation of current knowledge in this field and encourages students to foster their analytical study skills and critical thinking to keep up to date with the latest developments.This is a programme of multidisciplinary study and training in basic and applied biomedical science provided by the School of Medicine in partnership with the School of Biochemistry and Immunology, with collaborators from across Trinity and beyond.The majority of classes take place in the excellent teaching and laboratory facilities in Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute and in final year, students will conduct a research project in an academic research laboratory in this institute, on main campus or in one of the affiliated teaching hospitals.The course emphasises the crucial links between the basic and applied biomedical sciences and addresses how advances in both are translated into improvements in patient care and the health of the wider population. The skills developed during this course make graduates ideally suited to a broad range of career opportunities.Graduates of Human Health and Disease are well-placed to pursue postgraduate M.Sc. degrees in a wide range of biomedical sciences, PhD research leading to careers in biomedical research, and for graduate entry to study Medicine. Career prospects also include employment in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and in health promotion, education and policy.The degree is structured around three main interconnecting themes, namely: 1) Basic human biology 2) Applied biomedical science and 3) Transferable skills and Trinity graduate attributes.You will study the structure and function of the human body from a ‘molecule to man’ perspective through lectures, tutorials and laboratory classes in cell biology, biochemistry, physiology and anatomy (including dissection). Modules based on critical thinking, problem-based learning, presentation skills and research and statistics will further contribute to the development of a core skill set, as outlined above.In the third and fourth years, a combination of modules which cover the nature, classification, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease are taken. Disease is considered from the basic molecular level through to its context in society in terms of research and public health priorities and correlates. Delivery of clinically focused material by specialist clinicians is included.As a fourth-year student, you will undertake advanced modules on the molecular basis of disease and cutting-edge advances in biomedical science. A major component of the fourth year will be a comprehensive laboratory-based project in biomedical research supervised by leading researchers in Trinity and its affiliated teaching hospitals in Dublin. It may be possible for students may apply for selection via a competitive process to undertake this project at an ERASMUS partner institute.Project topics are varied and include, to name but a few, cancer biology, neuroscience, tissue engineering, gastrointestinal disorders, autoimmune disease, epidemiology and public health research.Click here for further information on modules/subject.Individual and group-based continuous assessment of laboratory work, group project work and scientific writing skills accompanies semesterised examinations.",

        "Overview": "About the programmeIdentities structure our reality, our desires and our ideas. As such, they assume many shapes and forms: the self and the nation, language and gender, migration and trauma, myth and ideology, class and religion, capitalism and populism, ecology and technology. Above all, identities are crystallised in their representation: in the media and popular culture, in literature and film, but also in imagined communities and destinies, contested histories, and collective memory. Exploring and analysing questions of identity as they have unfolded and continue to unfold in Europe, this intensive course will equip students with the critical tools and real-life experience to understand the complex and varied challenges posed by shifting notions of identity and their very real consequences. Master’s DegreeStudents on the MPhil enrol in two core modules (one in each semester) on Questions of Identity in Europe. Consisting of a selection of key identity topics, the core modules approach the issue of identity from a range of disciplinary perspectives through theories of identity and case studies. Students will also take four optional modules (two per semester), selected from a wide range of options offered by the programme as well as by other Masters courses at Trinity. Finally, students will complete a research dissertation on a topic of their choice, receiving guidance from researchers who are experts in their respective fields. During the first semester, students will also take part in a three-day field trip to Belgium, where they will have an opportunity to network and create links with key cultural institutions, organisations and NGOs on the continent. (Please note that Non-EU students are responsible for their own visa arrangements and must ensure that they can travel to Belgium and re-enter Ireland.) During the second semester, students will have the option to do an internship at an approved NGO or cultural institution in Dublin. (Please note that securing a placement may depend on availability in any given year and on the outcome of a selection process conducted jointly with partner institutions.) At the end of the second semester, students will participate in an identity workshop given by a high-profile external speaker from academia or civil society. Postgraduate DiplomaStudents on the Postgraduate Diploma enrol in two core modules (one in each semester) on Questions of Identity in Europe.

        "Overview": "Course OverviewThis one-year Masters course in Immunology provides academic, laboratory and research training in cellular and molecular immunology, with emphasis on the interface between basic, clinical and therapeutic immunology. A major focus is on understanding how inflammatory regulation is lost in disease processes including viral, bacterial and parasitic infection, as well as cancer, autoimmune and allergic disease.The M.Sc. in Immunology aims to provide students with a well-balanced and integrated theoretical and practical knowledge of Immunology, and to highlight the progress and intellectual challenges in this discipline. This course includes the study of immunological processes and mechanisms, how they contribute to disease and how they might be manipulated therapeutically. By focusing on the molecules, cells, organs and genes of the immune system, their interaction and how they are activated and regulated, students will develop a deep understanding of the pathological processes underpinning immune mediated disease and how they might be controlled. From a practical perspective, the course involves in-depth instruction in modern methodologies used in immunology/biomedical research, including the fundamentals of molecular and cellular biology. Students will also be trained in experimental design, data handling and basic research skills.The course is underpinned by modules in basic immunological principles and technologies.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Immunology apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (TR060) and may select Immunology as their specialist area for the third and fourth years at the end of the second year.Immunology is the study of the immune system. The immune system has evolved to protect our bodies against infection and cancer and involves the co-ordinated activities of specialised cells, molecules and genes to orchestrate an immune response.Immunology is one of the most rapidly growing research areas in biology and has been shown to have a fundamental role in almost all disease states. Understanding how the immune system works has led to the development of new therapeutics, e.g. antibodies, for the specific treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we can now harness the immune system such that it can help to fight against infection and cancer. Many pharmaceutical companies have substantial immunology programmes.If you want to understand how the immune system works, how its failures lead to disease and how we can use our knowledge to design new therapies for infection, cancer and a range of other diseases, this is the course for you. Trinity is not only the leading centre for immunology in Ireland but it is recognised around the world for its high level of research excellence. Graduating with an Immunology degree puts students in an excellent and competitive position for their future career. Immunology is a dynamic and rapidly expanding subject and this degree provides excellent training from world class researchers and lecturers to enable students to successfully pursue a career in immunology.Trinity is currently the only university that offers an undergraduate degree in Immunology in Ireland. Third and fourth year students will be based in the new state of the art Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI) on Pearse Street. Our students have the opportunity to study abroad for third year and there are also some internship opportunities, in Ireland and abroad.Graduates follow a range of different career pathways. Many of our students are recruited into PhD positions either here or abroad in order to pursue a research based career in the university, medical (hospital based research), or industrial sectors. Some of these are specifically within the area of immunology but other students diversify and use their immunology to branch into other areas. Some graduates go straight into lab based positions as immunologists and these can be in academic, hospital or industrial laboratories, e.g. Pfizer. Other students decide to use their scientific background for non-lab based careers, e.g. science communication and journalism, or science outreach. Some graduates have gone into research support positions, while others have gone on to get a business qualification or law qualification to enable them to be competitive in a business/commercial setting.Students will learn about all aspects of immunology: from the cells and molecules of the immune system and how they carry out their jobs in particular diseases, through to what happens when the immune system goes wrong and actually starts to attack our own bodies, as seen in autoimmune diseases. In order to fully understand the immune system, students will also cover important aspects of biochemistry, genetics and microbiology. One exciting aspect of this degree is that undergraduates experience real research as they undertake a final year Capstone project in a research laboratory in the School of Biochemistry and Immunology.The first two years are part of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (TR060). Students intending to take Immunology as their final degree take a range of required modules in biology, chemistry, mathematics as well as approved modules in other disciplines.Modules cover Immunology, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Genetics with a strong emphasis on practical skills. There is also a mini-review and a data handling project.Modules cover advanced topics in immunology and a final year Capstone project that takes place in a research laboratory in the TBSI building. A range of assessment types including continual assessment, annual exam papers and thesis will all be used over the duration of the degree. Currently, 30% of the marks towards your final degree grade come from third year.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Students can undertake to spend third year abroad. We have links with universities in Glasgow and Marseille. Some students have also studied in the US for their third year and returned here for their final year.",

        "Overview": "Global integration is not only a fact of modern life, but of modern history writing. The interconnectedness of distant societies and states, and powerful forces making for social, cultural and economic interaction have prompted significant scholarly assessment.This lecture-only module investigates some of the events and processes which have led to a more integrated world order between the mid-nineteenth century and the later twentieth century. For most of that period much of the world was carved up between a number of inter-continental empires centred in Europe. How those empires grew, exerted control and in due course retreated will be the particular focus of the module. But other processes, too, will be considered, not least the integrating force of economic changes and the spreading power of capitalism across the globe. Attention will be given to the evolution of ideologies of imperialism and social Darwinism and to whether or not such ideologies impacted upon changing global power relationships. The module, while broadly chronological in approach, will focus on a wide range of themes in cultural, economic and political history.How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ in December for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.

        "Overview": "The role of the nurse is to provide evidence-based, culturally-sensitive care in order to assist the individual to lead an independent healthy lifestyle, overcome ill health or experience a peaceful death. The nurse achieves this through working as part of a professional multidisciplinary team to provide primary healthcare, acute hospital care, community and home and continuing care, based on individual and population health needs across the lifespan.Students of nursing learn about caring and the complexities of health and illness through interactive teaching and learning strategies in the classroom and the healthcare environment. Practice (clinical and community) experience provides the student with opportunities to integrate the art and science of nursing and promotes the development of caring relationships with patients and their families/significant others.Nursing practice, rooted in compassion, draws upon extensive knowledge and experience to provide physical and psychological care of the highest quality. Nurses take centre stage in ensuring efficient and effective delivery of accessible, integrated and consumer-driven healthcare, creatively designing health related services, and ensure quality through advocacy, policy-making, service management, education and research.The four-year nursing courses (Children’s and General integrated is 4.5 years) are offered in partnership with six health service providers. Trinity’s linked health service providers for this course are:Do you love working with and for the benefit of people of all ages and from diverse backgrounds?If you want a rewarding and respected career with great employment and travel opportunities, then the professional course in nursing could be for you.A genuine interest in people and a desire to care for others are core requirements for any individual who wishes to become a nurse. In addition, you will need to have a keen interest in healthcare and be capable of working as part of a team. Like all professional courses in health sciences, nursing places extra demands on students’ time.

        "Overview": "Download our Course BrochureThis is an exciting new module which will equip you with an understanding of the drivers of human behaviour, and with the necessary skills to apply these insights to improve decision making, engagement and performance within your organisations. The module will provide participants with an analytical framework and a set of concepts that can be used to explain human behaviour. The course uses ‘classic’ findings and cutting-edge research from the social sciences, psychology, and neuroscience to document the interplay of forces which explain human behaviour. We begin by interrogating the assumption that humans behave ‘rationally’. We discuss examples of departures from rationality and the insights these afford into the human condition. In doing so, we examine the impact of emotions, ‘automatic’ processes/habits, cognitive biases and ‘heuristics’ (mental shortcuts) on decision-making and behaviour. We examine the extent to which human behaviour is shaped by the environment and context rather than individual agency and choice and discuss the possibility of using ‘nudges’ to steer behaviour in a particular (welfare-enhancing) direction. We then explore how social identities and processes (e.g., norms, beliefs, rituals and trust) influence behaviour and examine the extent to which models of behaviour change can inform the design and testing of behavioural interventions. Finally, we discuss the ethics of applying behavioural insights, particularly within a digital environment. While the module will provide participants with a solid grasp of the theory which underpins behavioural science, there will be a strong emphasis on teaching participants how to apply this knowledge in a variety of real-life organisational contexts.On completion of the module, you will:Department of Sociology, School of Social Sciences and Philosophy, Trinity College Dublin. The module will be delivered by Professor Diane Pelly. Diane has qualifications in business and economics as well as in psychology and worked for nineteen years in banking and finance with Citigroup and Zurich bank (among others). She is currently completing a doctoral degree in behavioural economics on work practices and worker well-being.The CPD will be delivered online over 8 weeks with one 2-hour session on Monday of each week. There will also be 9 hours of asynchronous material. In order to be awarded the Certificate of Completion in Applied Behavioural Science participants will need to attend and actively participate. ",

        "Overview": "Cuireann Roinn na Gaeilge fáilte roimh aon mhac léinn ar mhaith leo freastal ar roinnt léachtaí le blaiseadh a fháil ar chúrsa sa Nua-Ghaeilge i gColáiste na Tríonóide, ach teagmháil a dhéanamh linn.An Nua-GhaeilgeTugtar ‘Nua-Ghaeilge’ ar an teanga ón mbliain 1200 go dtí an lá atá inniu ann. Sa chúrsa seo léitear litríocht ó gach cuid den tréimhse agus déantar staidéar ar fhorás na teanga lena linn. Déantar staidéar speisialta freisin ar Ghaeilge an lae inniu agus ar Ghaeilge na hAlban.Tá cáil ar fhoireann Roinn na Gaeilge sna goirt ina bhfuil siad ag obair mar scoláirí agus iad ag foilsiú leo go rialta. Chomh maith leis sin, tá an-cháil ar an Roinn as a bheith cairdiúil, rud a thaitníonn go mór lenár gcuid mac léinn. Bíonn líon na mac léinn beag go leor le go mbíonn sé éasca do na mic léinn aithne a chur ar a chéile. Tá Cumann Gaelach na mac léinn an-ghníomhach ar fad; tá scéim chónaithe lánGaeilge a bhfuil an-tóir uirthi sa Choláiste. San iomlán, is geall le mionGhaeltacht i lár na príomhchathrach sinn.Tá réimse an-leathan gairmeacha ag daoine a rinne Nua-Ghaeilge anseo. Ina measc tá cuid mhaith múinteoirí, iriseoirí (sna meáin Ghaeilge go háirithe) agus daoine le postanna eile sna meáin: teilifís, ceol, beochan, raidió agus an t-idirlíon. Tá borradh tagtha ar líon na ndaoine a fhaigheann postanna mar ateangairí agus aistritheoirí, in Éirinn agus san Eoraip. Tá léachtóirí ollscoile agus leabharlannaithe againn chomh maith, agus iarmhic léinn eile ag obair sa tseirbhís phoiblí, le gnó agus le margaíocht.Is trí mheán na Gaeilge a mhúinfear do chúrsa. Foghlaimeoidh tú faoi gach gné den Nua-Ghaeilge: ón bhFiannaíocht sa 13ú haois go Máirtín Ó Cadhain agus Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill sa lá atá inniu ann. Cuirfidh tú go mór le do chumas i labhairt agus scríobh na Gaeilge, agus déanfaidh tú staidéar foirmiúil ar cheartúsáid na teanga. Beidh deis agat freastal ar léachtaí faoi: scéalaíocht na seanré, stair shóisialta na teanga, an béaloideas, filíocht na scol, an Fhiannaíocht agus an nualitríocht ar fad, .i.e. gearrscéalta, drámaíocht, úrscéalta, dírbheathaisnéisí agus filíocht. Caithfidh tú dhá mhí sa Ghaeltacht in Éirinn mar chuid de do chúrsa. Sainghné speisialta de chúrsa na Nua-Ghaeilge i gColáiste na Tríonóide ná gur anseo amháin a bheidh seans agat trí bliana a chaitheamh le Gaeilge na hAlban (a’ Ghàidhlig). Beidh seans agat, más mian leat, tréimhse a chaitheamh i nGaeltacht na hAlban freisin.Sa chéad bhliain agus sa dara bliain, díríonn an cúrsa ar na hábhair seo a leanas: scileanna i labhairt agus scríobh na teanga, an cheapadóireacht, an t-aistriúchán, stair shóisialta na Gaeilge, an Ghaeilge Chlasaiceach, an nualitríocht, Gaeilge na hAlban.Sa tríú bliain agus sa cheathrú bliain, díríonn an cúrsa ar na hábhair seo a leanas: ardscileanna teanga (labhartha agus scríofa), an cheapadóireacht agus an t-aistriúchán ag leibhéal níos airde, agus Gaeilge na hAlban. Foghlaimeoidh tú conas lámhscríbhinní a léamh (cúrsa sa phailéagrafaíocht) agus léirmheastóireacht chriticiúil a dhéanamh ar scéalaíocht na seanré. Ina theannta sin, déanfaidh tú rogha cúrsaí sa Nua-Ghaeilge Mhoch, sa litríocht bhéil, i nualitríocht na Gaeilge agus/nó i nualitríocht Ghaeilge na hAlban.Déanann gach mac léinn cleachtaí scríofa gach seachtain mar chuid den mheasúnú leanúnach; bíonn aistí le scríobh go tráthrialta, agus béaltriail agus scrúduithe scríofa ag deireadh an téarma. Sa cheathrú bliain, déanann mic léinn taighde neamhspleách agus scríobhann siad miontráchtas.Is aoibhinn beatha an scoláire a dhéanann leathbhliain thar sáile. Cé nach féidir staidéar a dhéanamh ar an nGaeilge thar sáile mar chuid de bhunchéim sa Nua-Ghaeilge, is féidir le mic léinn le Gaeilge, agus le Gaeilge agus ábhar eile leathbhliain a chaitheamh in ollscoil thar lear sa tríú bliain. Sa chás sin, déanfaidh siad a gcúrsa Gaeilge in aon leathbhliain amháin i gColáiste na Tríonóide, agus caithfidh siad an leathbhliain eile thar lear ag díriú go huile is go hiomlán ar an ábhar eile atá idir lámha acu.",

        "Overview": "This course offers an exploration of Irish writing in English from the late seventeenth century to the present. Trinity has educated many important writers, from Jonathan Swift to Samuel Beckett to Eavan Boland to Anne Enright. It has also long led the way in the teaching and researching of Ireland’s literature. Amid a diverse and dynamic community of students and scholars, this course will allow you to gain a thorough grounding in the field of Irish writing, from canonical figures such as Maria Edgeworth and James Joyce to contemporary critical debates around gender, sexuality, class and race.The centrepiece of the course is the core ‘Perspectives in Irish Writing’ module. Running across two semesters, it introduces students to the multiple contexts in which Irish writing in English has developed from the late seventeenth century through to the present. It also considers the literary history and reception of Irish writing, covering the main critical narratives and debates, as well as revisions of the Irish literary field as regards questions of gender, sexuality, class and race. A notable strength of Trinity’s faculty is the historical range of its research interests. This is reflected in the coverage given to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Irish writing. The final portion of the course also decisively turns to the eclectic state of contemporary Irish literature.Further exploration of the field of Irish Writing is offered through the core ‘Conditions of Irish Writing’ module. This focuses on the publishers, periodicals and institutions through which Irish writing has been produced and mediated, covering a wide range of historical periods, genres and writers. Further foundational grounding in issues of importance to studying and researching literature at postgraduate level is provided through the ‘Research Skills for Postgraduate English’ module. Students also take two specialist option modules, reflecting our commitment to cutting-edge research-led teaching. Within the Irish Writing programme, these modules focus on examining the work of significant Irish writers in detail. In 2021/22, these will include Maria Edgeworth, James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and Eavan Boland. A wealth of option modules from our other M.Phil. programmes, including the chance to take a creative writing option, are also available to you. In the final phase of the course, you will complete a dissertation. This will allow you to pursue in-depth research on a subject of your choice under expert supervision and drawing on our fantastic library and archival holdings.This course provides an excellent platform for moving on to doctoral research, as well as offering transferable skills for a variety of future careers, including in education, the arts, publishing and the media. Graduates have gone into careers in education, the arts and culture sector, librarianship, publishing, journalism, broadcasting, public relations, social work, the civil service and management consultancy. Many alumni have also gone on to become successful writers.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Studying Italian opens the door to a beautiful new world. Italy holds up to 75% of the world’s art treasures, has been home to some of the world’s greatest writers and thinkers (Petrarch, Dante, Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, Leopardi, Gramsci, Montessori), boasts fabulous food, fashion and design, and has a dynamic economy: 4th in the eurozone and 8th (by nominal GDP) in the world. Having fluent Italian is extremely beneficial for the job market; as Italian is less common, you will stand out. You do not need to have studied Italian before; most students of Italian start as beginners.Do you enjoy?Italian has been taught in Trinity since 1776. You join one of the longest traditions of teaching Italian in the world, one which includes alumni like Samuel Beckett and Douglas Hyde. We welcome beginners and advanced students. For beginners we offer accelerated language learning in a friendly and fun environment with highly skilled native teachers. For advanced, we provide one of the few dedicated advanced streams in Ireland to hone your skills. Native Italian speakers also join our programme: it provides a great foundation that opens a gateway to English-speaking economies and excellent job prospects.Your intensive language courses aim to support you in gaining fluency quickly. You will learn core skills (speaking, reading, writing, and listening) plus the art of translation. As well as language, you study a wide range of cultural courses. These include novels, poetry, theatre, cinema, art, as well as Italian history and contemporary politics. You can study Italy from medieval times (Dante Boccaccio, Petrarch and Machiavelli) to the 21st century.Advanced language and communication skills are in high demand – especially here in Ireland, a vibrant knowledge economy which depends on European and international trade. Our graduates develop successful global careers in management, law, journalism, charities, international business, translation, the arts, fashion, tourism, PR, diplomacy, finance, football management, teaching, and banking. Many of our graduates now live and work in, for example, Italy, France, Belgium, UK, USA and Hong Kong.You can build quickly on communication and language skills of a language degree, specialising once you are sure of your career direction. A short postgraduate course can take you into advertising, social media management, journalism, law, marketing, teaching, event planning, web development, operations management, research, and so on.At entry, Italian must be combined with one other subject. In later years you will be able to select additional subjects and electives. The degree offers you flexibility and choice.In first year, you follow an intensive course in Italian language. This includes grammar classes, conversation and listening practice, and learning how to write in Italian and produce basic translations. We provide about eight classroom hours per week, mostly devoted to anguage learning. You will also be introduced to Italy’s history and to some literature and cinema. In second year you continue language classes and explore Italy’s rich literary tradition including Dante’s Inferno, as well as modern Italian culture, history and Italian cinema.The third and fourth years focus on major authors of the medieval, Renaissance and 20th and 21st centuries, as well as contemporary Italian politics and life. You also study optional modules. In previous years, for example, we offered these options: Italian Drama 1470s-1530s, Italian Cinema 1900-2018, Gendered Narratives in 20th Century Italian Literature, The Poetry of Michelangelo and Introduction to Second Language Teaching and Learning.In your final year the programme includes advanced modules on Italian language varieties, cultural studies, and key literary texts and films. The final-year Capstone project, allows you to specialise in the area you find most interesting, supported by regular one-to-one meetings with a professor who will share their expertise with you.At all levels, you will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of traditional and innovative continuous assessment methods: essays, project work, presentations, book reviews and dossiers, podcast creation.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.A year or semester studying abroad is one of the highlights of the Trinity experience. Immersing yourself in Italian language, culture, life (and sunshine!) is a valuable way of achieving fluency. Single Honours students have a compulsory third year of study abroad and other students are encouraged to spend a year or a semester in their third year in one of our partner universities. At a minimum, you will be required to spend two months in an Italian-speaking country prior to taking your final exams. We currently have exchange agreements with the Universities of Bologna, Trieste, Pavia, and Rome",

        "Overview": "This module begins with the rise of Brian Ború from modest origins to become Ireland’s most famous high king—a spectacular career that ended in the iconic battle of Clontarf in 1014. We explore how Irish society and kingship changed in the aftermath of Clontarf as a result of inter- provincial warfare and the changing role of the church. The second half of the module examines the causes and implications of the English (or Anglo-Norman) invasion of the late 1160s, perhaps the single most formative development in Irish secular affairs. We study the interaction of cultures in its aftermath and the Irish opposition to English rule that saw the emergence of England’s ongoing Irish problem through later centuries. The module closes with the most serious challenge to English power in medieval Ireland: the Scottish invasion (1315-18) led by Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce king of Scots.Lecturer: Professor Seán Duffy.How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ after 16 August for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.You may apply online or by *phone as follows: ONLINE: You may register and pay online at http://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses AFTER enrolments openBy telephone: Please text ‘APPLY FOR COURSE’ to 087 257 2015* and you will receive a call back from us.Please note that the phone will be very busy during the application period so there may be a delay in replying to your call.

        "Overview": "Law governs every aspect of our lives, from food labelling and football transfers to elections and crime. It regulates our social life from the contracts that we make when we buy products to the laws that determine when people can be jailed for committing criminal offences, and through to significant political decisions, such as constitutional reforms on marriage or abortion. As a law student, you will learn what laws are, how they work and how they change.The law degree will appeal to you if you are interested in society and how it works, and with the broader question of the regulation of inter-personal relationships. A general interest in history and political developments, will be an advantage, as the law is deeply linked to its historical and political context. However given the wide range of legal modules on offer, this degree attracts students with a broad range of interests. Studying law involves learning legal rules, and interpreting, applying and critiquing legal principles. It requires the development of the skills of argument and advocacy as well as of critical analysis and reasoning. Legal training requires the ability to think logically and critically. Precise and careful use of language, good writing skills and a facility for articulate expression are key attributes for legal scholars.Trinity’s School of Law, is Ireland’s oldest and most internationally renowned law school and the highest ranked Law School in Ireland. We have a long established history for producing some of the most prolific lawyers of the modern era in Ireland. Our strong network of alumni in Ireland and abroad comprises leading lawyers, judges, a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Chief Justices, Presidents of Ireland, policy-makers and public representatives. We have a tradition for innovative teaching and curricula which is the lynchpin in ensuring our graduates are self- motivated, ethically aware and critically reflective citizens.Trinity’s LL.B. degrees prepare students not only for life as ‘lawyers’, but also enables them to enter many career fields such as business, journalism, accountancy, banking, insurance, politics, foreign affairs and public policy, both in Ireland and abroad. The skills learned through studying law are useful in all walks of life. A law degree teaches students to think logically and analytically. It also equips students with the ability to carry out research, to apply relevant information to problems, to use language precisely, carefully and objectively.No law degree entitles a person to practise law as a solicitor or barrister. If you wish to go on to obtain a professional qualification, the governing bodies for the profession require that you study certain modules in your primary law degree. Our Single and Joint Honours Law degree programmes are designed to ensure that you have the opportunity to take these required modules. Students reading for a joint honours law programme, who would like to go into professional legal practice after their degree, will need to ensure they pursue the professional pathway (i.e. taking law as a major subject) from the second year of studies onwards. Our programmes also offer additional modules currently required for entry into the UK professional bodies.All students considering a career as a lawyer should consult the relevant professional body of their preferred jurisdiction to ensure they satisfy all entry requirements.Law at Trinity College Dublin is a four-year honours degree programme. In the first two years, you will take foundational and professional modules, ensuring there is an appropriate balance between the academic and practical aspects of law. The Single Honours degree in law offers students the opportunity to study law in depth and breadth – with a wide offering of modules available to choose from in your final years of studies. This allows you to tailor your studies to develop specialised areas of interest – for example media law and Intellectual property law, corporate law or human rights law - or to continue down a general route. You will apply and enhance the research skills that you have developed in the previous three years of the programme by completing a piece of independent research – referred to as the ‘Capstone Project’. Working as part of a research group, you will work both independently and collaboratively to explore in-depth a topical issue. You will learn the skills of a lawyer: how to research the law, how to make legal arguments, how to use the law to protect and serve your clients.A distinctive feature of the Single Honours law degree is that you will also complete some modules outside of the School of Law. This will give you the opportunity to choose to study modules in a related discipline, or an unrelated discipline that is of interest to you. This is relevant both if you choose to pursue a career in the legal profession or if you follow an alternative career path.For detailed module information, please visit: www.tcd.ie/law/programmes/undergraduate/modules/There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.The Law School has long recognised the value of practical, skills-based training. Clinical legal education offers students a valuable opportunity to learn more deeply about the law by gaining practical legal experience. Offered in the final year, 35-40 students undertake a placement in a legal practice setting in a partner organisation in the private, public or not-for-profit sectors. Students also attend a lawyering class in which they develop their understanding of professional legal skills and legal ethics. We are privileged to have many of the leading legal practice settings in the State, in each of the private, public and not-for-profit sectors, among our partner organisations which offer placements. The lawyering class complements the placement by enabling students to identify and develop the skills, values and knowledge which is necessary for making the transition from the academic study of law to its application in a real world setting.Assessment in law degrees is by a combination of coursework and semester examinations. As a reflection of the different teaching practices, a diverse range of assessment methods is used, including case notes, essays, mock trials, reflective journals, mock parliaments, contribution to web-discussion boards, response papers and research dissertations. Students are advised at the beginning of the teaching semester about the assessment methods in each module.Third year students may apply to study abroad in a prestigious European university with the EU funded Erasmus programme. We also have links with leading universities in North America, Australia, Hong Kong and China which you may choose to apply to spend a semester or year in. These programmes are highly successful and are an extremely popular amongst our students each year. Participating students find that they are hugely enjoyable, academically and culturally rewarding, and a valuable asset to prospective employers.

        "Overview": "Ireland’s membership of the European Union, combined with globalisation, makes it more important than ever that lawyers are able to understand other legal systems and cultures. A key global distinction is between ‘common law systems’, such as Ireland, England, and the USA, and ‘civil law systems’, found in France, most other European jurisdictions, and beyond.The Law and French degree course satisfy these needs as students graduate with a grounding in Irish Law, fluency in a second European language and knowledge of the general culture, political, economic and sociological make-up of France.If you like to be challenged and intellectually stimulated, have a keen interest in the cultural, social, historical and political background of France and would like to learn a second language, then one of these degrees is for you. Legal training requires the ability to think logically and critically, precise and careful use of language, good writing skills and a facility for articulate expression are key attributes for legal scholars.The Law and French degree programme offers a unique opportunity to study core and specialised legal modules but also the language, culture and political systems of France. Students must undertake an Erasmus year in France, exposing them to the law of that legal system. The class sizes are small, fostering a close collegial relationship with peers and members of the both schools.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.The increasing Europeanisation of legal practice means that graduates of the law and a language degree programme have much to contribute to the legal and other professions in Ireland, as well as enjoying career opportunities in Europe. In addition to careers in the legal profession, Law and French graduates also find employment in business, journalism, accountancy, banking, insurance, politics, foreign affairs and diplomacy and public services.No law degree entitles a person to practise law as a solicitor or barrister. If you wish to go on to obtain a professional qualification, the governing bodies for the profession require that you study certain modules in your primary law degree. Each of our five undergraduate degree programmes guarantees you that will have the opportunity to take these modules. Students reading for a Joint Honours law programme, who would like to go into professional legal practice after their degree, will need to ensure they pursue the professional pathway (i.e. taking law as a major subject) from the second year of studies onwards (see opposite). Our programmes also offer additional modules currently required for entry into the UK professional bodies.All students considering a career as a lawyer should consult the relevant professional body of their preferred jurisdiction to ensure they satisfy all entry requirements.In the first and second years, you will study a variety of legal modules, taken alongside students reading for our other undergraduate law programmes. You will also further develop your language skills through studying a variety of modules on French language, politics and cultural studies. New entrants are not expected to be fluent; rather they will develop their language skills through the degree.The third year is a compulsory year spent studying legal and language-related modules in one of France's top-ranking universities. This year abroad is designed to enable the student to enhance their knowledge of French law whilst perfecting their fluency in the foreign language. Further information on the year abroad programme, and a list of partner universities, can be found at: https://www.tcd.ie/law/programmes/undergraduate/study-abroad/At the end of the first year of your programme, you can choose to major in law (we refer to this as the ‘professional pathway’ – leading to the degree of LL.B. (Ling. Franc) or you can major in French (resulting in a B.A. degree). You may of course choose to continue studying both subjects equally (B.A. Law and French) or move into Single Honours Law (LL.B.). Students considering a career in the legal profession after their degree will have the opportunity to take all the required modules if they choose the ‘professional pathway’. Nevertheless, there will still be ample opportunity to continue with your studies in French. In your final year, depending on the pathway that you take, you will have the opportunity to focus on developing areas of interest in Law and/or French modules on literature, culture, history and society. You will also be required to complete a research project on a topic of your choice.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course.

Legal training requires the ability to think logically and critically, precise and careful use of language, good writing skills and a facility for articulate expression are key attributes for legal scholars.The Law and German degree programme offer a unique opportunity to study core and specialised legal modules but also the language, culture and political systems of Germany. Students must undertake an Erasmus year in Germany, exposing them to the law of that legal system. The class sizes are small, fostering a close collegial relationship with peers and members of the both schools.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.The increasing Europeanisation of legal practice means that graduates of the law and a language degree programme have much to contribute to the legal and other professions in Ireland, as well as enjoying career opportunities in Europe. In addition to careers in the legal profession, Law and German graduates also find employment in business, journalism, accountancy, banking, insurance, politics, foreign affairs and diplomacy and public services.No law degree entitles a person to practise law as a solicitor or barrister. If you wish to go on to obtain a professional qualification, the governing bodies for the profession require that you study certain modules in your primary law degree. Each of our five undergraduate degree programmes guarantees you that will have the opportunity to take these modules. Students reading for a Joint Honours law programme, who would like to go into professional legal practice after their degree, will need to ensure they pursue the professional pathway (i.e. taking law as a major subject) from the second year of studies onwards (see below). Our programmes also offer additional modules currently required for entry into the UK professional bodies.All students considering a career as a lawyer should consult the relevant professional body of their preferred jurisdiction to ensure they satisfy all entry requirements.In the first and second years, you will study a variety of legal modules, taken alongside students reading for our other undergraduate law programmes. You will also further develop your language skills through studying a variety of modules on French/German language, politics and cultural studies. New entrants are not expected to be fluent; rather they will develop their language skills through the degree.The third year is a compulsory year spent studying legal and language-related modules in one of Germany’s top-ranking universities. This year abroad is designed to enable the student to enhance their knowledge of German law whilst perfecting their fluency in the foreign language. Further information on the year abroad programme, and a list of partner universities, can be found at: https://www.tcd.ie/law/programmes/undergraduate/study-abroad/At the end of the first year of your programme, you can choose to major in law (we refer to this as the ‘professional pathway’ – leading to the degree of LL.B. or you can major in German (resulting in a B.A. degree). You may of course choose to continue studying both subjects equally (B.A. Law German) or move into Single Honours law (LL.B.). Students considering a career in the legal profession after their degree will have the opportunity to take all the required modules if they choose the ‘professional pathway’. Nevertheless, there will still be ample opportunity to continue with your studies in German. In your final year, depending on the pathway that you take, you will have the opportunity to focus on developing areas of interest in Law and/or German modules on literature, culture, history and society. You will also be required to complete a research project on a topic of your choice.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.A combination of assignments and aural, oral and written examinations is used.

        "Overview": "What do we mean by modern Ireland? Where is modern Ireland and when did it begin? Having broached these questions, this course will investigate what life was like on the island of Ireland across the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Reflecting the increased focus on social and cultural themes in Irish historiography, this course addresses the ways in which historians are tackling a broad range of societal questions. What characterised peoples’ family, working and social lives? How did people interact with the apparatus of the state and of religious bodies? How did the evolution of media affect daily life? What forces and ideas shaped the provision of education and welfare? What impact did emigration have on both host and home societies? Key to the course is an understanding of what differentiated experiences; how did gender, class, geography and moral/status hierarchies of different kinds shape individual lives? It will also place the social history of Ireland in comparative and global contexts, in order to question ideas of Irish insularity and exceptionalism.Lecturers: Dr Anne Dolan; Dr Carole Holohan; Dr Ciarán O’Neill.How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ after 16 August for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.

        "Overview": "Linguistics is the scientific study of language. Linguists investigate how language works; how patterns of sounds, words and sentences combine to convey meaning. Language is fundamental to nearly every aspect of human experience: how we communicate, our sense of identity, how we interact socially, how we think. Linguists explore all these areas and more. They study everyday language use, how it varies and changes geographically, socially and across time, and how children acquire language.Even when they investigate specific languages, linguists are often trying to shed light on language in general. Some investigate how people acquire their knowledge about language and what this tells us about how the mind works. Many linguists investigate how languages vary across speakers, social groups and geographic regions, and some are involved in the documentation and maintenance of endangered languages. Some make computational models of speech and language based on collections of spoken and written language.Linguistics often appeals to students who are curious about language as one of the most fascinating aspects of human knowledge and behaviour. Perhaps you are interested in accents, dialects, or slang, or you are a good learner of languages, or you are intrigued by how language changes over time, or you wonder how humans manage to learn and produce language. Linguistics is also appealing to those who enjoy detailed, problem-solving analysis and careful argumentation. Students of Linguistics engage in evidence-based analysis of language, acquiring skills and techniques that allow investigation of different aspects of language structure such as sound, words and grammar. This involves key transferable skills in problem solving and critical thinking.This new undergraduate subject builds on a decades-long tradition of Linguistics teaching and research in the Centre for Language and Communication Studies (CLCS). Teaching is research-led: all members of the teaching team are engaged in state-of- the-art work in the various subfields of theoretical and applied linguistics. CLCS boasts a highly equipped Phonetics and Speech Laboratory providing a wide range of analytic empirical approaches to the study of the structure of spoken language, and a tie-in with the many ongoing research projects.There is a strong postgraduate presence, including both Masters and Ph.D. students, and a lively research ethos, as well as opportunities to interact with other undergraduates in the School such as those in Clinical Speech and Language Studies and the Centre for Deaf Studies. Students are encouraged to participate actively in the wider scholarly activities of CLCS such as seminars and reading groups.The pathways available are Major with Minor and Joint Honours. There may also be an opportunity to take this subject up as a New Minor Subject from second year.A Joint Honours degree with Linguistics provides an excellent foundation for professions involving language-centred expertise, such as speech and language therapy; education, including language teaching; media; journalism; PR and advertising; IT including speech and language technology; translation and interpreting. Pathways for academic and research careers abound: Linguistics has natural affinities for areas like sociology, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and anthropology.Training in Linguistics promotes the critical evaluation of evidence, logical and detailed analysis, and the formulation and presentation of arguments. Graduates will be able to take an objective view of theoretical and practical issues, formulate researchable questions and hypotheses, identify and implement appropriate research methods, and critically evaluate competing theories and frameworks.The Linguistics course concentrates in the first two years on core areas and concepts of Linguistics; in the final two years there is scope for specialisation and in some pathways greater optionality. Most teaching is in lecture or seminar format; phonetics and speech modules take place in a laboratory. Certain modules are supported by tutorials.In the first two years of the Linguistics course you will learn about many aspects of human language, including how sounds are produced and perceived (phonetics and phonology), how words are built (morphology), how words are combined to form sentences (syntax), how meanings are expressed (semantics).Depending on your chosen pathway, you will be taking modules from among the following:A wide menu of modules in the third and fourth years offers deeper specialisation as well as exploration of applied and interdisciplinary topics. Depending on your chosen pathway, you will be taking modules from among the following: If you take Linguistics as a Major subject, you will complete a Capstone Project on a chosen topic in your final year. You will be assigned a supervisor to help you with topic selection and planning and to provide you with support in research and writing. The project is also supported by a third-year module in Research Methodology.A wide range of assessment formats is used, including collection and analysis of data, take-home problems, classroom tests, research reviews, oral presentations, and some examinations.Students have the opportunity to spend one or both terms abroad in third year on an Erasmus exchange. CLCS has connections with a large number of European universities with a strong record in Linguistics, including in Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Austria, and France.",

        "Overview": "Linguistics is the systematic study of human language. It has its roots in antiquity, though the twentieth century saw an explosion of research and the development of new theories and approaches. Linguistics has become an exciting and vigorous area of study, with strong connections to many fields including psychology, sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, computer science, and philosophy.Language is complex, and linguistics attempts to describe and explain the full range of that complexity, especially speech sounds, the grammar of words and sentences, and how meaning relates to words, grammar and context. The M.Phil. in linguistics gives due weight to all of these, with core modules in Describing Grammar, Describing Meaning, Describing the Sounds of Languages, and Laboratory Phonetics and Phonology. A varied menu of optional modules gives students the opportunity to investigate social, psychological, historical and advanced topics in linguistic theory.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.The M.Phil. in Linguistics has been running for nearly 30 years. Our students -- who are not expected to have any background in linguistics -- have in some cases come from language professions (translating, interpreting, teaching, speech and language therapy, publishing...), or direct from undergraduate degrees which include language-centred elements (English, modern languages and literature, anthropology, classics, psychology, sociology). In other cases, they have simply been people who are intrigued by language and wish to study it in a more systematic fashion. In general, the M.Phil. in Linguistics is likely to appeal to students with a talent for careful, systematic argument, and who wish to understand the mysteries of language.Our alumni have followed various career paths in the professions named above, with many opting to pursue research at a higher level through the Ph.D., in CLCS or elsewhere. For some, Ph.D. research has led to an academic career.For more information be sure to visit the course website, and don’t forget to read the Frequently Asked Questions.

        "Overview": "M.Phil - The MPhil in Literary Translation is a unique opportunity to develop a wide range of practical skills related to translation, while also building a strong understanding of the theory and history of translation thought and a keen critical eye. The programme is based in the Trinity Centre for Literary and Cultural Translation, Ireland’s foremost centre for the study and practice of literary and cultural translation. Our students are ideally placed to build professional networks and to see the translation industry from the inside.The course’s name uses the term “literary”. However, this should not be taken to indicate only novels and poems. In fact, the course’s definition of “literature” is so broad as to include anything that involves human creativity, including video games, subtitles, speeches, comics, and songs.Translation, and especially the kind of creative translation we develop as part of the MPhil in literary translation, has been a subject of huge interest in recent years, both within academia and in industry. At the same time, the demand for well-qualified translators continues to grow internationally, and this form of translation more than any other is coming to be valued as something that is not easily done by machines.The MPhil in Literary Translation equips you with the skill to apply translation theory to your literary translation practice in creative and original ways. You will craft a unique portfolio of translations under the guidance of academic and professional mentors. You will take part in team projects, aimed at simulating the realities of the translation industry, and you will be trained in the latest specialist translation tools.On this varied and demanding course, you will be provided with a wealth of opportunities to develop your understanding of translation, expand your practical translation skills, and prepare either to work in translation or to undertake advanced research.Checkout our course video to get an idea of what it’s like to be one of our students.Each student takes all six of the core modules, and chooses two of the option modules. Each student also produces a portfolio and a dissertation under the supervision of specialists.Core Modules• Theory and History of Translation• Linguistic and Textual Analysis• Aspects of the Profession• Interlingual Technologies• Research Training Seminar• Literary Translation PortfolioOption ModulesThis list may vary year by year and some options may not be available every year Michaelmas Term (autumn)• Discovering the Other: East-West Encounters in Translation History• Translation Studies Methodologies• Dantean Echoes• Europe and Its Identities: A Cultural History• Medieval and Renaissance Foundations of Western Europe• The Russian Avant-Garde Hilary Term (spring)• Madness, Nonsense and Identity in Literature• European Cinema and Identity• Don Quixote: Romance, Comedy and the Modern Novel• Food, Drink and European Cultural Identities• The Communist Century: Culture, History, Representations• Postmodernist Literature in East and Central EuropeClick Here for further information on modules/subject.PortfolioEach student crafts a portfolio of 8-10 literary texts of their choice, together with short commentaries on the strategies used and how effective these were in reaching their intended goal.DissertationEach student completes a 15-20,000-word dissertation. This dissertation can take the form either of a theoretical analysis of one or more translations, or an experimental translation and commentary, in which a student posits a new way to translate, and demonstrates it.Teaching and LearningThe programme is delivered through a combination of lectures, seminars, and practical workshops. The modules are assessed by essays, presentations and projects. There is no examination.Working languagesEnglish is the common language for all our students, and students must have a demonstrably very high level of English to apply. We do our best to accommodate as broad a range of working languages as possible for our student translators. Our students regularly work with the following languages: • Bulgarian• Catalan• Chinese• Croatian• Czech• Dutch• French• German• Irish• Italian• Japanese• Polish• Portuguese• Russian• SpanishPlaces are limited. Therefore, you are encouraged to contact us as early as possible to check whether your working languages are still available for the coming year. We are happy to accept queries from applicants working with languages not listed here, though we cannot guarantee availability.FundingFor a comprehensive list of the funding opportunities available at Trinity, please visit the Postgraduate Scholarships Website.Career OpportunitiesThere is a strong and growing demand for highly-trained translators with the creativity and linguistic prowess to create aesthetically appealing work. Such translators are already sought out not only in the field of literature, but also in the private and public sector, in international organisations, media, and education. We have close ties with many such organisations, and give our students regular opportunities to interact with them.The programme develops eight key competences that build the practical, professional, and theoretical skill base of students:1. Transfer competenceThe ability to identify issues in translating texts, and to formulate strategies to achieve identified goals.2. Language competenceThe ability to use many variations of both the source and target languages to a very high level of competency.3. Textual competenceThe ability to distinguish and reproduce literary genres and styles.4. Heuristic competenceThe ability to gather the linguistic and thematic knowledge needed to translate.5. Literary-cultural competenceThe ability to apply knowledge about differences between source and target cultures, literary movements and genres while producing translations.6. Professional competenceThe ability to gather knowledge and understanding of working in the field of literary translation.7. Evaluative competenceThe ability to assess and evaluate translation choices and translations' impacts.8. Research competenceThe ability to conduct methodical and rigorous research in translation studies.These competencies enable our students to pursue careers in the fields of translation and interpreting, as well as localisation, project management, editing, and promoting. Recent graduates have gone on to work as translators, editors and project managers, to work for NGOs, and to pursue advanced research in the form of a PhD.Why study this degree at Trinity?Located in the heart of multicultural Dublin, Trinity College provides a uniquely rich environment for studying and researching translation.

        "Overview": "Organisations, institutions, and society face challenges that are complex and multi-faceted. These challenges are often referred to as wicked problems and, as such, require multidimensional solutions. Design Thinking has its roots in industrial design and engineering and borrows from psychology, computer science and ethnography. It provides an excellent framework to explore user-centred solutions to challenges in an iterative manner. Rather than being problem-focused, Design Thinking is solution-focused and action-oriented. It involves both analysis and imagination and works most effectively in multidisciplinary or cross-functional teams.This Masterclass introduces Design Thinking methodology. You will discover how to apply the principles of Design Thinking to address real world challenges in your own business or organisation. You will learn how to apply a user-centred, iterative approach when tackling complex problems and developing products and services. You will examine the use of empathy mapping as a process for understanding a customer’s journey to your product or service.The Masterclass is offered in two formats:The Taster Session and Masterclass are both designed and delivered independently.The Taster Session will introduce you to the core concepts of Design Thinking and will give you a practical understanding of essential Design Thinking skills and mindsets.

        "Overview": "Medicine is a unique course in that students study a broad range of subjects with the overarching objective of understanding the science and practice of healing. In today’s world, medicine and the practice of healthcare are constantly evolving as new knowledge and therapies emerge to maintain and restore health through the prevention and treatment of illness. Each day brings a new patient with new challenges.The medical programme at Trinity is a challenging but highly rewarding experience. A student wishing to study medicine requires an enquiring mind, the capacity to acquire and maintain high levels of knowledge, the ability to develop effective communication skills in order to respond to the health needs of individuals, families and communities and an interest in improving healthcare at all levels.Founded in 1711, the School of Medicine at Trinity has played a central role in the golden age of Irish medicine and is ranked in the top 150 universities in the world for Medicine (QS World University Rankings 2020).Students of medicine at Trinity will follow a five-year programme. Following graduation you are required to spend one year as an Intern in an approved post before becoming a fully registered medical practitioner.As a doctor, you will have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to making a decision about your career. In Ireland, many graduates wait until their year as an intern is complete before committing to one area over another. Some then enter general practice, while many more continue their training as a general physician or surgeon, or in a related specialist field. Alternatively, you might, as others have done, prefer to work in an area such as hospital management, or make research your priority by opting for a career in academic medicine.Students study the biomedical sciences to create an understanding of the knowledge underlying medicine and begin clinical science in the first term through the Family Case Study. Teaching is a combination of problem based learning in the first year, small group teaching (12-14 students), lectures and practical demonstrations.Self-directed learning and use of e-learning are encouraged throughout the course. The majority of the teaching in first and second year takes place at the School of Medicine, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute at the main University campus, with the remainder in the hospital setting. Third year combines the taught course programme and an extensive clinical placements programme in order to advance and integrate clinical skills.On successful completion of the third year, you may be permitted to take a year out from the medical course to undertake a moderatorship in science in an approved subject. This is subject to the availability of places and the agreement of the head of department concerned. An intercalated M.Sc. in Biomedical Sciences is also available to medical students who successfully gain a 1st or 2:1 in year 3 modules. The M.Sc. is a one-year full-time programme.During these two years the student becomes an integrated member of each team to which he/she is attached and is expected to participate fully in all aspects of that team’s activities. This expectation will inevitably involve some early morning and late evening work. The majority of hospital attachments take place in St. James’s Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, Dublin; however, some training also takes place in regional hospitals around Ireland, in hospitals dedicated to particular areas of medicine and in general practices associated with the School.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Click here for more information for applicants.Trinity’s two main general teaching hospitals, St. James’s Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, are up-to-date tertiary level hospitals. They have several specialist units. Specialist affiliated hospitals include: Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, Hermitage Medical Clinic, Naas General Hospital, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Noble’s Hospital, Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital (Crumlin), Our Lady’s Hospice and Care Services (Harold’s Cross and Blackrock), Peamount Hospital, Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and St. Patrick’s University Hospital.The assessment structure is wide and varied and includes in-course assessment of practical and clinical skills, as well as case studies, research projects, formal written and oral examinations and objective structured clinical examinations. Formative assessment and reflective practice are also used to promote the personal development of the student and inform teaching and learning.The School of Medicine has a strong international network and students have the opportunity to gain experience overseas as part of the electives programme. Students are required to complete clinical electives totalling 12 weeks by the final medical year and these can be undertaken in a hospital, clinic or research laboratory of the student’s choice at home or abroad.On completion of the medical degree course a doctor must successfully complete training for one year as a resident medical officer/intern in a recognised post before being eligible for full registration with the Irish Medical Council. A national application and matching process is in place for Intern posts in Ireland. This is currently managed by the HSE. Graduates undertaking internship/residency outside of the Republic of Ireland will be required to register and meet the eligibility criteria of the relevant governing body in that jurisdiction.",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Microbiology for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Microbiology as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Microbiology is the study of the structures and life processes of micro-organisms (such as bacteria, protists, fungi and viruses) together with their activities and effects, beneficial and detrimental, on plants, animals, humans and the environment. It also studies the control of these effects and the harnessing of microbial processes for applications in biotechnology. A microbiologist is a versatile scientist and studies microbes at both cellular and molecular levels, using a wide range of techniques, and will also be proficient in microbial biochemistry and genetics.The Microbiology course reflects the diversity of research excellence within the department, which is home to world-renowned experts in all aspects of microbiology including virology, infection biology, biotechnology, bacterial molecular biology and fungal genetics. The Microbiology degree ensures students gain first hand practical experience in the laboratory in all aspects of microbiology.If you study Microbiology at Trinity you will be based in the historic Moyne Institute. The Microbiology department offers an intimate atmosphere where frequent interaction between staff and students fosters an intellectually stimulating and friendly environment for teaching and learning. To provide the extensive laboratory experience on offer, the Moyne Institute houses state of the art research and teaching laboratories containing all the equipment and expertise required for modern molecular and cellular microbiology.Graduates in microbiology have a wide range of expertise and are considered versatile scientists for industry or pure research. This makes them sought after by pharmaceutical and medical research laboratories as research and quality assurance staff in drug and medical device manufacture, as analytical or Research and Development (R&D) staff by the food and beverage industries, by public utilities, the health service, by teaching and training establishments and publishing houses, in life science sales and product development, medical relief organisations and many other areas. Such employment may find you working with multinational or small companies in Ireland or abroad, working with leading-edge biotechnologies in the production of drugs, enzymes, antibiotics, vaccines or agricultural products. Many graduates go on to do a higher degree in Ireland or abroad and enter a rewarding career in many of the areas mentioned or continue a research career in a university.Core modules cover all aspects of modern microbiology and include; microbial Physiology and Biochemistry, Pathogenicity and Immunology, Bacterial Molecular Biology and Genetics, Eukaryotic Molecular Biology and Genetics and Applied Microbiology. Each module comprises lecture and laboratory components. The extensive laboratory training covers the safe handling of pathogenic microorganisms, separation of their components and products, genetic analysis and biotechnological techniques.In the final year, alongside advanced core microbiology modules, you will also choose from optional modules reviewing the leading edge of research and knowledge in topics such as: gene regulation and expression in bacteria and eukaryotic microbes; molecular pathogenesis (disease mechanisms) of infectious disease; regulation, issues and standards in current microbiological practice; clinical microbiology; virology; emerging pathogens and host-microbiome interactions.In final year, you will also undertake a 9-week, full-time Capstone project under supervision in a research laboratory. You will work at the cutting-edge of research on topics like bacterial and fungal synthetic biology, design of new anti-microbial drugs, viral pathogenicity, immunology, and novel methods for disinfection in hospitals.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.For students wishing to study abroad, Microbiology staff can offer advice on how to seek funding for summer vacation placements from external sources such as the Wellcome Trust and the Microbiology Society.",

Language competence is one of the biggest skills gaps in the Irish labour market and language graduates are highly sought after in a variety of sectors.We invite you to study languages in Trinity’s School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies. It is a leading language school in Ireland and consistently ranked in the top 100 languages schools in the world.Within the Modern Languages programme you study two modern European languages. It is the most intensive exposure to languages and cultures that Trinity College has to offer. You can choose between French, German, Irish, Italian, Russian and Spanish. Apart from French and Irish all languages can be studied from both advanced and beginners level. (See table for all available combinations).In today’s globalised world and the post-Brexit times we live in, competence in languages is a key asset for rewarding international careers and for Ireland to stay connected, prosper and maximise its opportunities as an economy, society and culture.Trinity’s School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies consistently ranked in the top 100 languages schools in the world. In Trinity’s Joint Honours entry routes, you can study a Modern European language with a wide variety of other disciplines across the Humanities and beyond. The languages to choose from are French, German, Irish, Italian, Russian and Spanish. Apart from French and Irish all languages can be studied from both advanced and beginners level (see table for all available combinations).Studying two languages at Trinity will enable you to develop your skills to a level where you can communicate confidently and competently on virtually any subject and in every situation. Throughout your studies you will experience an intensive and exciting encounter with the people, cultures and societies of the languages you study. You will gain deeper familiarity through the study of their literature, culture, history and politics, and you will gain competencies in understanding and successfully navigating cultural differences. You will also acquire crucial and highly valuable transferable skills such as thinking analytically and independentlyChoosing a modern language plus another subject allows you to combine an interest in languages with an entirely different academic discipline, and will give you intensive exposure to both of your subjects, their methodologies and specificities. You will find that very often the topics as well as the approaches of your two subjects will intersect and complement each other very well.Modern Languages: The pathways available are Major with Minor and Joint HonoursModern Language plus another subject: The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.Foreign language skills and intercultural competencies constitute one of the biggest skills gaps in the Irish labour market and language graduates are very sought after in a wide variety of careers. Dublin-based headquarters of Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and others are seeking the advanced language and intercultural skills our graduates acquire, and there is currently an acute shortage of language specialists in the Irish secondary school system. Our graduates have exciting careers in a wide range of fields such as cultural and creative industries, translation and interpreting, journalism and the media, publishing and arts administration, diplomacy and tourism, marketing and finance, as well as second and third-level teaching or the civil service. Many go on to take postgraduate courses in areas such as business or law for which a languages degree is an excellent background.Modern Languages: In each of the languages you have typically 8-12 contact hours per week, which roughly divide equally between language learning and studying the culture, literature, history and society of your languages.Modern Language plus another Subject: In each of your two subjects you will have typically 8-12 contact hours per week. In the language part of your programme, this divides equally between language learning and studying the culture, literature, history and society of your languageIn beginners languages the emphasis on language is higher in the first year. From year to year students have an increasing choice in respect of which areas to focus on and specialise in. All students complete a Capstone – an independent research project – in their final year. For further details see the entries under the specific languages in this prospectus.A year or a semester studying abroad is one of the highlights of a student’s Trinity experience, and immersing oneself in the language and culture is one of the most valuable ways of achieving fluency and of gaining deeper intercultural understanding.Modern Languages: For those who choose the Single Honours pathway, study abroad is mandatory in third year (except for Irish). For students combining the study of two modern languages we endeavour to facilitate a semester abroad in either or both, and all our students are strongly encouraged to spend at least a semester of their third year at one of our many partner universities. At a minimum, you will be required to spend two months in each of the countries the language of which you are studying during the course of the degree programme. We have long-established and well-working Erasmus partnerships with top institutions in the countries where our languages are spoken.Modern Language plus another Subject:For those who choose the Single Honours pathway in the language a third year of study abroad is mandatory (except for Irish).

        "Overview": "Neuroscience is a discipline concerned with the scientific study of the nervous system in health and disease. Research in the neurosciences is of considerable clinical impact considering the debilitating and costly effects of neurological and psychiatric disease. In this regard, a major goal of modern neuroscience research is to elucidate the underlying causes (genetic or environmental) of major brain diseases, and to produce more effective treatments for major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression, and neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, motor neurone disease and epilepsy. Improved treatment strategies for brain disorders relies entirely on increased understanding gained from research which integrates molecular, cellular and clinical aspects of disease. In this regard it is clear that interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to understand the complex processes which underlie brain function in health and disease. This interdisciplinary philosophy is adopted in the delivery of our M.Sc. programme in Neuroscience, which is underpinned by the diverse research expertise available within Trinity College. The M.Sc. course in Neuroscience is held in the Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, located within Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience (T.C.I.N.) and Trinity College Biomedical Sciences Institute (T.B.S.I.).Course Content:This one-year M.Sc. course aims to provide a multidisciplinary training in the neurosciences, in topics ranging from molecular to behavioural. The course is ideal for students wishing to extend their specialised knowledge, and for those wishing to convert from their original degree discipline. The programme will equip participants with the skills necessary to progress into a career in biomedical, pharmaceutical or neuropsychological research. Instruction for the course consists of approximately 200 contact hours over two academic Terms to include lectures, laboratory practical sessions, journal club workshops and student-based seminars. Modules are assessed by a mixture of in course assessment and written examinations. Those with some knowledge in neuroscience and pharmacology will be most suitable for this one-year intensive course.Specialist modules covered include:Form and Function of the Nervous System, Biochemical Basis of Neuropharmacology, Neuropharmacology, Drug Development, Experimental Neuroscience, Current Experimental Techniques, Advanced Research Skills in Epilepsy, Literature Review, Neuroimaging, Neural Engineering, Statistical Skills, Experimental Research Skills, Clinical Research Neuroscience.The third Term consists of a research project on novel aspects of Neuroscience. The School of Medicine, Trinity College Biomedical Sciences Institute and Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience collectively form a dynamic research environment with research spanning molecular/cellular neuroscience to clinical/translational neuroscience. Projects across these research areas may be undertaken in consultation with an expert supervisor. For students interested in a project in cellular/molecular neuroscience a range of cellular techniques such as tissue culture, immunocytochemistry, western immunobloting and immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, Immunoassays, flow cytometry, Real-time PCR, and high performance liquid chromatography are available. In addition, some projects will involve assessing behavioural, electrophysiological and neurochemical endpoints using in vivo models of neurological and psychiatric disease. For those with an interest in experimentation on human subjects, projects will be offered utilizing techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurocognitive testing. A selection of national and international projects is also available, which involve collaboration with other academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies, in Ireland, UK and across Europe.The course runs for 1 year full time, normally starting in the last week of September and running to July in the following year. The Research Project is based on some novel aspect of Neuroscience and takes place in the final term on the course.The course will equip participants with the skills necessary to progress into a career in biomedical, pharmaceutical or neuropsychological research. Graduates have pursued Medical and Health related degrees, direct entry into research labs, as well as PhD research across the world, from Ireland to Australia.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Neuroscience apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (TR060) and may select Neuroscience as their specialist area for the third and fourth years at the end of the second year.Neuroscience is the discipline concerned with the scientific study of the nervous system in health and disease. It probes the intricate processes of the nervous system in an attempt to understand how we think, move, perceive, learn and remember. Research in the neurosciences is of considerable importance in medicine, considering the debilitating and costly effects of neurological and psychiatric disease. In this regard, a major goal of modern neuroscience research is to elucidate the underlying causes of, and to produce more effective treatments for, major brain diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia and depression.Neuroscience is an ideal topic for students who have an interest in understanding how the brain works. Additionally, the topic is suited to students who are interested in using concepts and techniques from a variety of biological disciplines. The neuroscience degree in Trinity brings together lecturers from diverse backgrounds including psychology, physiology, biochemistry, immunology, pharmacology and genetics to deliver a truly multidisciplinary training. This diversity is also reflected in the range of laboratory projects offered during this degree, which offers students broad horizons after graduationTrinity has a strong research focus in Neuroscience centred around the Institute of Neuroscience (TCIN) with 45 research groups and 250 researchers within the Lloyd Building and in labs in the many affiliated academic schools and departments that drive Neuroscience activity in Trinity. These research groups investigate a wide variety of topics in Neuroscience and Trinity neuroscientists are well respected by the neuroscience community worldwide, regularly contributing at international meetings and in high impact publications. This breadth of research expertise is the driver for excellence in teaching across a range of disciplines within this degree. There is a lively research community within TCIN, including undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and principal investigators and it’s interdisciplinary ethos allows for fruitful interactions between scientists of various backgrounds. This community regularly meets at seminars and social events to discuss the latest news in the field and beyond.Graduates in Neuroscience can expect to find employment in a wide range of areas, utilising their general scientific training as well as their specialist skills. In the past Neuroscience graduates have pursued careers in academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical research organisations. Some graduates study for higher degrees in neuroscience, biology or psychology or, medicine or allied health-related disciplines. For those not seeking a research or medical career, the course provides transferable skills and experience that are suitable for a wide variety of careers, e.g. in education, business, management and industry.Neuroscience links neurobiology with cognitive science and, as a result, modules in multiple disciplines (Anatomy, Biochemistry and Immunology, Genetics, Pharmacology, Physiology and Psychology) are provided. The course involves in-depth instruction in the fundamentals of modern molecular and cellular biology, as well as in the structure and operation of the nervous system. Other modules focus on the development of the nervous system, its response to injury and disease, the relationship of the brain to behaviour, imaging the brain, and the drug treatment of brain disorders. You will also be trained in scientific methodology and experimental design, data handling and research skills.The third year will cover core topics in Neuroscience including: Neuroanatomy and Development, Systems, Behavioural and Cognitive Neuroscience, Neurophysiology, Neurochemistry, Neuropharmacology, Neurogenetics and Molecular Neuroscience as well as research skills, basic laboratory skills for Neurobiology and a Trinity Elective.Some modules are assessed by examination; however some modules are assessed entirely by in-course assessment and some are assessed by a combination of in-course assessment and examination. Written examinations are part of the final year exams. Third year Neuroscience results constitute 30% of the final Moderatorship result.The final year will examine some more specialised areas of Neuroscience and examine others at a more advanced level. Topics will include Neuropsychology, Neurochemistry, Neuronal and Glial Physiology, Neuropharmacology, Developmental genetics, Neuroimmunology and Neurodegeneration, Neuropsychiatric Genetics. There will be a greater focus on research with modules involving scientific literature skills (literature review and journal clubs) and all students will carry out a major Capstone research project in one of the many research groups in the schools that contribute to the Neuroscience degree.Modules are assessed by continual assessment based on written assignments, oral presentations and literature reviews and written examinations. The Capstone research project is graded according to performance across many elements: oral presentation, literature review, poster presentation, student performance in the laboratory and the submitted dissertation.This degree is also available within the Dual B.A. Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University. Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Students may arrange to study abroad during their third year following discussion with staff. Students are also facilitated in seeking internships, in Ireland or abroad, during the summer and some opportunities exist for research laboratory placements within the university.Two BA Honours Bachelor Degrees (NFQ Level 8) Degrees awarded by Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin and Columbia UniversityThe Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University offers students a unique opportunity to earn two BA degrees while spending the first two years at Trinity and years three and four at Columbia University in New York.This course is for those interested in expanding their experience to gain a truly international education.

        "Overview": "The role of the nurse is to provide evidence-based, culturally-sensitive care in order to assist the individual to lead an independent healthy lifestyle, overcome ill health or experience a peaceful death. The nurse achieves this through working as part of a professional multidisciplinary team to provide primary healthcare, acute hospital care, community and home and continuing care, based on individual and population health needs across the lifespan.Students of nursing learn about caring and the complexities of health and illness through interactive teaching and learning strategies in the classroom and the healthcare environment. Practice (clinical and community) experience provides the student with opportunities to integrate the art and science of nursing and promotes the development of caring relationships with patients and their families/significant others.Nursing practice, rooted in compassion, draws upon extensive knowledge and experience to provide physical and psychological care of the highest quality. Nurses take centre stage in ensuring efficient and effective delivery of accessible, integrated and consumer-driven healthcare, creatively designing health related services, and ensure quality through advocacy, policy-making, service management, education and research.The four-year nursing courses (Children’s and General is 4.5 years) are offered in partnership with six health service providers. Trinity’s linked health service providers for this course are:Do you love working with and for the benefit of people of all ages and from diverse backgrounds?If you want a rewarding and respected career with great employment and travel opportunities, then the professional course in nursing could be for you.A genuine interest in people and a desire to care for others are core requirements for any individual who wishes to become a nurse.

        "Overview": "The main goal of occupational therapy is to enable people to participate in meaningful activities of everyday living, for example, self-care, work and leisure activities. By enabling people to engage in activities that hold meaning for them, occupational therapists aim to enable people to improve their day-to-day quality of life.Occupational therapists work in a variety of settings, including community, hospitals, rehabilitation units, schools, universities and reform centres. Examples of what occupational therapists do include:Occupational therapy interventions consider:This is the right course for you if you are a creative thinker who is open to finding solutions to a multitude of problems and if working with people with diverse abilities is something you enjoy and find stimulating. The course requires a high level of independent self-directed learning across a variety of academic modules as well as the completion of the mandatory practice education placements. Visiting an occupational therapy department will give you more understanding of what is involved in this profession.The course is the longest established university-based occupational therapy course in Ireland. It uses many innovative teaching methodologies, including peer education, problem-based learning, online learning, as well as more traditional methods. Students and staff collaborate on projects that involve both research and service delivery, in existing and new areas of practice.Occupational Therapy is based in the Trinity Centre for Health Sciences in a purpose-built complex in the grounds of St. James’s Hospital. The Trinity Centre for Health Sciences is located approximately 3 kilometres from the main campus, beside the Luas line running between Tallaght and the city centre. There are state of the art teaching facilities at the Discipline of Occupational Therapy, including a capacity for teleconferencing. The Trinity Centre houses other health sciences disciplines including Medicine, Physiotherapy, Radiation Therapy, and Nursing. This gives a multidisciplinary dimension to studying and working with other health professionals. A small number of modules on the course may take place on the main campus and offer opportunity for interaction with students from other undergraduate courses. Additionally, there will be an opportunity for students to engage in inter-professional learning with other health science students during the four-year undergraduate programme.As a qualified occupational therapist from Trinity, you will be well equipped to pursue a very rewarding career working with people of all age groups in a wide range of service settings. The course is regulated by CORU, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, and upon successful completion of the programme you will be eligible to apply for registration to practice as an Occupational Therapist in Ireland. In addition, the course has professional validation from the Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland (AOTI) on behalf of the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (www.wfot.org), meaning the qualification has international recognition that may enable you to work as an occupational therapist abroad. Many graduates from the programme are working in all parts of the world. Most occupational therapists, over time, develop specialised expertise in areas such as physical rehabilitation, mental health, hand therapy, intellectual disability, paediatrics, services for the elderly and community occupational therapy.Practice areas and the focus of practice are expanding, particularly in primary care and community practice areas, as well as some opportunities in private practice. The focus of practice is also evolving to include nontraditional client groups such as homeless, refugee and school-based services, and working with ‘well’ populations using health promotion and self-management based approaches to facilitate living well and prevention of occupational dysfunction. There are also opportunities for occupational therapists to move into management – managing occupational therapy departments or other health/social care related services. Additionally, the course offers many opportunities for further postgraduate study and research.This four-year degree course incorporates a practical, occupation-based approach to solving problems and fosters a research-oriented and reflective attitude. It embraces evidence-informed practice.The subjects studied in the first and second years include the study of occupation, occupational therapy theories and interventions with people from children to older adults, anatomy, psychology, disability studies, research methods and statistics. You will be required to be an active participant in your learning and to engage in both theoretical learning as well as practical based learning as required for modules covering professional behaviour and technical skills of the profession, for example professional communication, assistive technology and splinting. You will be required to engage in service learning through voluntary work and will use experiential learning and group work to develop knowledge and skills fundamental to the development of professional behaviour and practice. During the first two years, there are a total of 10 weeks in supervised practice education placement in a variety of health and community care facilities around the country. Assessment includes written examinations, essays, project work, presentations, and competency-based assessment while on supervised practice education.During third and fourth year you will further develop your knowledge of the theories, principles and practice of occupational therapy; gain an understanding of health/ social care systems and policies and of the importance of practising in an develop research skills and an appreciation of the importance of practising in an evidenced-informed manner. In fourth year you will complete an occupation-centred project and modules incorporating leadership and critical reasoning. You will have opportunities to develop important self-directed learning and research skills, which are key areas for practice and continuing life-long learning. Over the course of the final two years, you will spend a total of 22 weeks in supervised practice education. Assessment includes written examinations, essays, project work, presentations, a research project, and competency-based assessment while on supervised practice education.Click here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Pharmacy is the study of all aspects of drugs, both natural and synthetic in origin, including their chemistry, their uses in medicines, and how they work within the body. Pharmacists work in a variety of settings – community pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and within the pharmaceutical industry, to name just a few. In many respects, their role as a key healthcare professional is to help people achieve the best results from their medications.While this degree is an essential requirement if you wish to practise as a community or hospital pharmacist, Pharmacy at Trinity opens up a wide variety of professional opportunities in both industry and the wider healthcare sector. A strong interest in science is important to fully enjoy the course.Trinity is ranked in the top 25 universities in the world for Pharmacy and Pharmacology (QS World University Rankings by Subject 2022). The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences has world class facilities with research space in the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute (TBSI), which develops Trinity’s leadership position in immunology, neuroscience and cancer. The School also has purpose built teaching spaces in the Panoz Institute, including the Boots Unit, a technology-enhanced learning space which allows students to dispense drugs and develop communication skills.Structured professional placements are integrated throughout the new programme and these take place in second, fourth and fifth year. A particular strength of the Trinity programme is the undergraduate research project, which may take place abroad and gives students the opportunity to develop focused laboratory or field research with one-to-one supervision.As an expert in the discovery, development and optimal use of medicines, many career paths are open to pharmacists. Your career prospects as a Pharmacy graduate are excellent. Employment opportunities exist in community, hospital and industrial pharmacy, as well as in state services such as medicines licensing. In addition, you can opt to undertake research, or apply for entry to one of the postgraduate courses in hospital, industrial or community pharmacy. See: www.pharmacy.tcd.ie/postgraduate for further details.The Pharmacy syllabus has been designed to provide you with an all-round education in both the basic and pharmaceutical sciences and in the practice of pharmacy itself. The five-year integrated Pharmacy programme comprises a variety of approaches to teaching Pharmacy including: lectures, seminars, tutorials, workshops, small-group teaching, problem-based learning, site-visits, computer-assisted learning, web discussion boards, wikis, online group assignments, communication skills, career planning, clinical case studies, inter-professional learning, laboratory and dispensing practicals, and a research project.The programme is delivered as a series of integrated modules, examples of which include:Modules are assessed by final examinations and continuous assessment, such as written assignments, essays, lab reports, OSCEs (objective structured clinical examinations), etc. which contribute to the overall mark in a module. There are approximately 16 hours of lectures, 6 hours of laboratory classes and 1 tutorial per week over the course of the first year. Work experience in clinical and non-clinical settings will take place over all five years of the integrated Pharmacy programme.In the fourth and fifth year, you will undertake a research project. The following are some examples of research projects which students have undertaken in the past:Click here for further information on modules/subject.We encourage our students (second and third year students) to undertake the summer research placement programme.

        "Overview": "Philosophy is an intellectually exciting discipline in which fundamental questions of human existence, value and society are examined, debated and challenged. Its methods are reason and argument and philosophy students are given the skills to reason and argue clearly, cogently and effectively. Rather than a body of doctrine, philosophy is a method or a way of approaching abstract general questions such as what is a good life, what is the fundamental nature of reality, what is the purpose (if any) of human existence?This course offers the opportunity to engage in depth with questions of metaphysics (about the fundamental nature of reality), epistemology (the theory of knowledge), ethics (theories of right and wrong), political philosophy (the nature of the just state), philosophy of religion (reasoning about God), philosophy of mind (questions about thought, language and reason) and various other areas. Trinity’s Department of Philosophy, in the School of Social Sciences and Philosophy, is ranked in the 51-100 in the world (QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2021) and the staff are world-recognised specialists in their respective areas of expertise. The department's approach is predominately, but not exclusively, within analytic philosophy, which focuses on conceptual analysis and logical precision, and is unique in this respect in Ireland.Our Department is small and student-friendly while offering a world-class programme in philosophy. We teach courses which have both systematic and historical emphases and in the higher years students can choose options and get to write a thesis on a topic of their own choice. Trinity Philosophy students have regularly won prizes at the International Undergraduate Awards competition and also have gone on to the major graduate programmes in the world. There is a lively student society, the Metafizz, which offers the opportunity of combining social activities with philosophy.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.In the recent past, graduates of Philosophy have worked in areas as diverse as accountancy, academic teaching, journalism, law, TV reporting and research, filmmaking, banking, computing and advertising. Each year some graduates also opt to pursue a research career, beginning with postgraduate study in Ireland or abroad.Research on graduate entry aptitude tests in the US (GRE) show that philosophy graduates outscore all other disciplines in two of the three main areas (verbal reasoning and analytical writing) and tend to do well in the third, quantitative reasoning. The kind of reasoning and analytical competencies acquired in studying philosophy are transferable to a multiplicity of careers.The Philosophy course is designed to give you a solid, scholarly grounding in the classical texts that form the history of Western philosophy, and are one of the formative influences on Western culture. Studying the fundamentals of both formal and informal reasoning will support you to think independently.In the first two years, you will study foundation courses in the history of Philosophy, as well as engage with certain fundamental philosophical problems such as the debates about free will and determinism, the nature of morality, the nature of language, the existence of God, logic, and the scope and limits of human knowledge.In the Joint Honours programme, where Philosophy is studied with another subject, there are approximately five hours of classes per week; with double that for the Single Honours programme.In the final two years, you are able to set your own syllabus by selecting courses from a reasonably wide choice including political philosophy, ethics, philosophy of religion, and philosophy of mind, among others. In this way you can specialise in the areas of philosophy you have found most interesting and most suitable to your skills.Assessment is by means of both essays and formal examinations with equal importance given to both. In fourth year, you will undertake a Capstone project. For more detailed information on all the modules offered, see: www.tcd.ie/philosophy/undergraduate/course-outlinesThere are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.This degree is also available within the Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University.Students have attended a wide variety of universities in different countries, generally in their second year. As we do not require students to attend a specific university, there is a great choice available (students choose a university in consultation with teaching staff).

        "Overview": "Philosophy, Political Science, Economics and Sociology (P.P.E.S.), offers a coherent and integrated introduction to the study of social sciences and philosophy. It brings together some of the most important approaches to understanding society and, in doing so, develops skills for a whole range of future careers and activities.Central to the programme is the analysis of social and human phenomena through the lens of several complementary disciplines and analytical frameworks. By allowing a gradual specialisation over the course of the four-year degree programme, students ultimately obtain an excellent grounding in one, or at most two, of the disciplines which comprise the course.Particularly appealing is the complementarity across the P.P.E.S. disciplines. For example, while the well-publicised rise in inequality has economic origins, it has political and sociological ramifications. Moreover, the question of whether to address it is ultimately a philosophical one. A training in PPES enables students to analyse such issues rigorously and comprehensively. As such, it provides an excellent training in analytical thinking, a skill highly prized by employers.Drawing on the methods and insights from philosophy and the social sciences, the course examines the way societies are organised, governed and create wealth. If you are curious about the way our world is structured and how it has evolved over time, this may well be the course for you.A great strength of P.P.E.S. is its flexibility and the way it facilitates a range of possible subject concentrations and career trajectories. Even within disciplines there is a wide range of subject offerings. Within economics, for instance, students could study the workings of financial markets or, taking a more long-run perspective, study why some countries have become richer than others over time.While all students attain a broad training in their first two years, the final two years allow students to cater the programme to their own strengths and interests. Depending on your interests, by your third year you could be either analysing exchange rate movements or Plato’s Republic---or indeed doing both! Few courses anywhere offer such scope and diversity.Trinity College is the only university in the Republic of Ireland that offers this broad combination of subjects in a single programme. Other institutions, including Trinity, offer two subject combinations such as Economics and Political Science or Economics and Philosophy, but P.P.E.S. offers the opportunity to study these four fascinating subjects together. Following the first two years, the programme facilitates two years of greater specialisation in either one or two of the subjects. At Trinity, we have world-class teachers and researchers who are committed to providing rigorous, interesting and challenging courses. With technology increasingly replacing routine tasks, employers today value the ability to think creatively and to develop innovative solutions to complex problems. A key strength of PPES is it provides students with such a training. Having studied a number of disciplines and developed numerous analytical skills, this degree confers the insights and skills to pursue careers in a variety of areas including public administration, teaching, journalism, media, law and management. Moreover, Philosophy, Political Science, Economics and Sociology (P.P.E.S.) also offers the opportunity to specialise and target certain career paths. Students specialising in economics, for instance, can pursue careers in finance, consulting, and public policy. Testifying to its breadth, graduates have pursued a variety of career paths after graduation. Recent graduates have found careers in such varied workplaces as Accenture, Augustus Cullen Law, Channel 4, Bank of Ireland, Deloitte, the Irish Central Bank, Greenpeace, and RTE. The link below gives information on the career paths taken by our graduates. www.tcd.ie/careers/resources/publicationsIn first year you will take all four subjects: Economics, Philosophy, Political Science and Sociology.In second year you can choose to continue with one, two or three of the subjects and could, for example, take modules ranging from Intermediate Economics, to the History of Philosophy to International Politics, to an Introduction to Social Theory. Additionally, depending on the pathway that you decide upon, you can choose from a wide range of Designated Open Modules and Trinity Electives.In third year you concentrate on one or two of the four subjects and, in addition, can take modules from a range of designated open modules and Trinity ElectivesIn the fourth year you may choose to take one or two subjects and can exit with a Single Honours, Major with Minor or Joint Honours award. All Students will complete a Capstone project in their final year. Module Descriptors for all four years of the programme can be found on the PPES website: https://www.tcd.ie/ssp/undergraduate/ppes/current/post-2019-20/module-outlines/There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.In third year, students have the opportunity to apply to study abroad in a prestigious European university with the EU-funded Erasmus programme. In addition to Erasmus programmes in Europe, the Departments also have bilateral links with leading universities across the world. Our exchange programmes are highly successful, and are an extremely popular option for P.P.E.S. students each year. Participating students find that they are hugely enjoyable, academically and culturally rewarding, and appeal to prospective employers.

        "Overview": "Did you ever wonder why your smart phone battery needs to be recharged? Or why planets and stars don’t crash into each other? From particles to planets, from crystals to chaos, from quanta to quasars and from superconductors to supernovae, physics can explain and answer many of our questions and curiosities.Physical Sciences (TR063) at Trinity is a four year degree programme for students who like to solve problems. Whether it is studying galaxies, examining the potential of new lasers or investigating next generation nanomaterials, this degree pathway will prepare you for a lifelong career of solving problems in research, industry or business.In the School of Physics our presence at the forefront of cutting-edge research allows us to contribute to ground- breaking advances relevant to society today. Our interdisciplinary approach to research requires national and global collaborations - an approach that influences our teaching and students mindset. In your fourth year of this programme, you will develop specialist research knowledge by carrying out a Capstone research project in our state-of-the-art facilities or with one of our collaborators in Ireland or abroad (e.g. US, UK, France, Germany, China and Australia).As well as practical knowledge of the subject, our programme is designed to help you to develop many other transferable skills valued by both employers and the wider community. These range from critical thinking and problem-solving skills to understanding complex mathematical/physical behaviour. Every year, graduates from all our degree courses are drawn from a range of sectors of industry, business and society are invited back to share their experiences with our current students. Our student societies host a career fair for students so you can meet employers. The School of Physics annual Alumni Careers Networking evenings enable you to hear from a range of graduates what they are doing in their careers today.Our physics degrees are accredited by the Institute of Physics, the professional body for physicists in Ireland and the UK. This opens up a pathway to become a ‘Chartered Physicist’ (CPhys). Since 2017, Trinity is also a member of LERU, a League of European Research Universities in recognition of our outstanding education, research and innovation; something that you will experience first-hand in our physics programmes.In first and second year, you will study foundation topics in physics including classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, special relativity, and thermodynamics through our lectures, tutorials and computational and experimental laboratory classes. This will be hand-in-hand with the study of mathematics and your choice of open modules from other science subjects. These strong foundations in physics and mathematics will allow you to study more advanced topics in the physics, astrophysics and nanoscience degree programmes in later years.In third and fourth year, all students study central topics such as quantum mechanics, statistical physics and condensed matter physics. In addition each student must opt to specialise in one of our three moderatorships:Physics: Advanced topics include magnetism, semiconductor devices, materials and electronic structure, superconductivity, nanoscience, modern and non-linear optics, nuclear physics and structure, high energy physics and optional topics such as energy science, polymers, soft matter, and computer simulation and energy science.Physics and Astrophysics: Specialised astrophysics topics include stellar and galactic structures, planetary and space science and cosmology together with nuclear physics and structure, and high energy physics.Nanoscience: Advanced topics include nanoscience, condensed matter physics, specialist courses in thin films, polymers, soft matter, solid state chemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, all emphasizing nanomaterials.All have tailored practical courses developing appropriate laboratory, experimental, computational and analysis skills as well as participation in research-level final year Capstone projects carried out in a research laboratory in Trinity or in another university, research institute or astrophysical observatory (e.g. US, UK, France, Germany, China and Australia).Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "The Physics and Astrophysics course studies the Universe, how it has arisen, and the ways in which it functions. Using the laws of physics derived from the world around us we apply these on cosmic scales and times to study topics such as the formation of planetary systems, how stars are powered and evolve, the structure and motion of galaxies, as well as everything in between. Physics and Astrophysics students study the fundamentals of classical and quantum physics, the physics of motion, energy and of light, applying to both individual particles and ensembles of particles, on scales from the macroscopic and the microscopic encompassing atomic, nuclear and fundamental particle physics, but extending to stellar, galactic and cosmic scales. The emphasis in the latter years turns more towards Astrophysics, observational data analysis and the understanding of what happens based on our observations of the universe. The course puts an emphasis on data analysis to understand the world, skills which underpin many modern careers and not simply that of a research astrophysicist. Physics and Astrophysics is taught within the School of Physics but has strong astrophysical teaching and research links beyond Trinity. All of our lecturers run research groups with major strengths in light pollution studies, radio astronomy, exoplanets, and stellar astrophysics among others. Every student is encouraged to apply physics to the Universe at large and computational skills are developed. Research training culminates in the individual Capstone research project carried out in the final year on a topic in either astrophysics or physics. Typically, students become very skilled in analysis of observations, in computer simulations and in the handling and analysing of large datasets. Your general scientific training and specialised knowledge can lead to employment in a wide variety of careers. As a graduate, you are qualified to work in any Physics career and recent graduates have gone into medical physics or education careers. Further training in astrophysics can lead to a research career at an institute or university, or you can use your skills to find employment in high-tech industries, financial services, information technology, or as a data scientist. Third yearYou will study the Physics of quantum systems, electromagnetism and of collective behaviours underpinning condensed matter and the electronic and physical structure of materials as well as the Astrophysics of galaxies and stars and observational astrophysical and spectroscopic analysis techniques with specialised laboratories in astrophysical data analysis. Options include computational physics, experimental techniques and semiconductor physics and devices. The experimental programme of advanced laboratory experiments in the JS year also has a major emphasis on developing your science communication skills. You will also broaden your studies by taking Trinity Elective modules in non-science subjects.In the final year you study advanced modules in planetary science, space science and cosmology alongside advanced quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, advanced electromagnetism, and problem solving. Further options include computational physics, magnetism, photonics and energy science. You will undertake an individual Capstone research project in an astrophysics or a physics topic that is guided Trinity Professors and working within their research groups or with associated collaborating institutes or universities. Recent research projects have looked at topics ranging from observations with I-LOFAR antennas, through to study of solar eruptions, exoplanet atmospheres, evolution of stars in the early Universe and supernova explosions.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Many of our students undertake research internships in Trinity or other universities during the summer vacation. Our students have won scholarships to work in research laboratories between 3rd and 4th year from the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, Armagh Observatory, or the Dutch research agency ASTRON amongst others.

        "Overview": "Physics is the study of the laws of the universe, how these function at our everyday classical scales, at smaller quantum scales of atoms, nuclei and fundamental particles, of electrons and photons in vacuum, in materials, in devices and nanostructures, of complex collective behaviours, and how these laws act over the immense scales of stars and vast distances of the universe. Physics encompasses all of this and more.Physicists view the behaviours within the world in terms of all observable interactions. The known law of physics are a distillation resulting from this viewpoint, governing every aspect of the world around us. In this course you study the fundamentals of classical and quantum physics, the physics of motion, of energy, of light, of individual particles to ensembles of particles, whether on cosmic scales, the nanoscale, or the quark scale. Your study includes materials, semiconductors and nanostructures, atomic, nuclear and fundamental particle physics, collective behaviours of electrons in magnetism, photons in modern photonics, and thermodynamic principles applied to gases, stars or quantum systems and computer simulation. This degree encompasses all of physics inclusive of nanoscience and cosmology and the underpinnings of our world and its behaviours.The School of Physics has strong teaching and research links with other departments in Trinity and beyond. All lecturers run research groups with major strengths of the department being in photonics, magnetism, nanomaterials, nanoscience, energy materials and energy processes, microscopy, spectroscopy, quantum systems, computational physics, foams as well as astrophysics. Every student is encouraged to consider themselves as a physicist from day one and trained to observe and interpret. Physics research training culminates in the individual Capstone research project each student carries out in the final year. All students gain both a practical, handson experiences, in addition to deep physicsbased understanding in how to approach problem solving.Graduates of physics not only have general scientific training with specialised knowledge of physics but have a deep understanding of complex mathematical behaviours and how to creatively problem solve, resulting in employment in many diverse positions and industries. You may pursue further training in physics and become a research scientist in industry, university, or institutes. Some graduates undertake further study in medical physics, in education or in business degrees.Students who wish to study physics apply to the physical sciences stream (TR063) and at the end of second year may select physics as their specialist area for the third and fourth years.You will study the Physics of quantum systems, of electromagnetism and of collective behaviours underpinning condensed matter and the electronic and physical structure of materials as well as atomic and semiconductor physics and devices.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Physiology for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Physiology as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Physiology is the study of the function of living things – it spans the spectrum of Biology from molecular and cellular physiology through to the function of organs systems and ultimately the whole body – including how we survive in different environments and adapt to them.Physiology is the foundational biomedical science because it underpins translational and clinical medicine. Understanding physiology is essential to understanding ourselves and our health. Physiologists study every aspect of the human body, from the function of individual proteins in cells, to the function of body systems such as the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems, all the way through to the integrated, whole body level. The emphasis on integrating molecular, cellular, systems and whole body function is what distinguishes physiology from other life sciences Physiology is at the forefront of research in biomedical science, because there are still so many things about the function of the human body that remain unknown. If we know more about our physiology we can use this knowledge to develop better treatments for various diseases.The Physiology Department is part of the School of Medicine and has strong teaching and research links with other disciplines in the school, such as physiotherapy and clinical medicine, and with other schools in the Faculty of Engineering, Mathematics and Science. All of our lecturers run research laboratories and the major strengths of the department are in neuroscience, cell biology and exercise physiology. In Trinity, we recognise the vital importance of laboratory teaching. We encourage every student who enters the teaching laboratory to consider himself or herself as a research scientist from day one. This research training culminates in the individual Capstone research project each student carries out in the final year. We train students to design experiments that may help to solve some of the mysteries that remain about the function of the human body. We teach them how to make accurate measurements, how to generate data, how to analyse those data and how to draw conclusions based on the data. Using this hands-on approach, they gain a much deeper knowledge of the subject of physiology.You can use your general scientific training and specialised knowledge of physiology to find employment in a wide variety of jobs. You may pursue further training in physiology and become a research scientist in a hospital, the pharmaceutical industry, a government agency or a university. Some graduates undertake further study in health-related fields such as medicine or physiotherapy.You will study the Physiology of all of the body systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, reproductive, digestive etc.) from the cellular and tissue level to how each system integrates with other systems. You carry out individual and group project work in JS year and there is a major emphasis on developing your science communication skills. You also have an opportunity to study complementary modules in other areas of Biology and you can take Trinity Elective modules in nonscience subjects.In 4th year you study advanced modules in Physiology that draw directly from the research ongoing in the department. You will also undertake an individual Capstone research project, where you work alongside a Trinity Professor in his/her research laboratory. Your project will be based in Trinity or in one of its associated hospital departments. Some typical recent research projects have looked at reprogramming stem cells to cure Parkinson’s disease, assessing the influence of premature birth on hypertension later in life, using exercise training to improve blood vessel health in diabetes and assessing biomarkers of brain health in athletes playing contact sport.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Many of our students undertake research internships in Trinity or other universities during the summer vacation.

        "Overview": "Physiotherapy – or physical therapy – places full and functional movement at the heart of what it means to be healthy. It involves treating patients of all ages with a range of illnesses and conditions, including those with back and neck problems, sports injuries, arthritis, or those recovering from strokes and operations. The focus of our treatment is exercise prescription. Physiotherapists may be part of a multidisciplinary medical team that includes physicians, nurses, speech and language therapists, psychologists, occupational therapists and social workers among others. Alternatively, they may work from clinics or specialise in particular areas of the discipline.Physiotherapy is both physically and academically demanding and an interest in working with people is an requirement, alongside strong communication skills. Visiting a local general hospital or other area where physiotherapists work will give you a good understanding of what exactly is involved.Physiotherapy is based in the Trinity Centre for Health Sciences in a purpose built complex at St. James’s Hospital. This complex houses other health science disciplines and allows physiotherapy students to share courses with those in the other health sciences to give a multidisciplinary approach to studying and working. The centre is about 3 km (2 miles) from the main campus and is beside a Luas station on the line running between Tallaght and Connolly Station in the city centre.All students will have clinical placements at Trinity’s associated teaching hospitals of St. James’s and AMNCH in Tallaght, where there is an established expertise in most areas of physiotherapy. These placements allow students to gain experience in some of the specialist areas of physiotherapy including neurology, respiratory care, coronary care, orthopaedics, women’s health, care of the elderly, sports and out-patients.Successful completion of the course entitles you to membership of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists, the accrediting body for physiotherapy in Ireland. Physiotherapists are sought throughout the world and you will be able to work with a wide range of conditions or to specialise, as you wish. There is also great scope for you to continue to develop your skills and expertise in areas such as sports medicine, neurology, cardiology, respiratory, research, education, management or private practice. Students may also work with a professional sports team as part of multidisciplinary athlete support.The major objective of this four-year course is to enable you to become a competent professional with the ability to work independently with patients. There are two components to Physiotherapy: theory and clinical practice. In the first year the emphasis is on laying a foundation of theoretical knowledge and the second year introduces students to the clinical skills and procedures used by physiotherapists. Clinical sciences are taught mainly in the second and third years. In the third and fourth years students spend up to fifty percent of their time on clinical placement. In the fourth-year, students have an opportunity to develop specialist knowledge in a particular area of physiotherapy and undertake a research project.In first and second year as you will have approximately 20 hours of teaching each week, divided between lecture and practical classes.Courses covered in the first two years include:You will also start to study various conditions and specialities frequently seen in physiotherapy, such as respiratory conditions and musculoskeletal conditions.At the end of second year you will start clinical placements under the supervision of skilled and experienced tutors. These may be taken in hospitals, clinics, day centres or within private and community practice.In the third year, half of the time is spent on academic studies and the other half on clinical placements in a variety of settings both within and outside the Dublin area.In fourth year, you will undertake an investigative project and study the following subjects: sports and exercise medicine, ergonomics, professional issues and advances in physiotherapy.Click here for further information on modules/subject.End-of-year written examinations and tests in certain subjects, such as anatomy, make up the theoretical assessment structure. There are a number of submitted assignments in third and fourth years.In addition, you will be continuously assessed during your clinical placement and will have practical exams on the skills element of the course, including your assessment of a patient while on a clinical placement.",

        "Overview": "Political Science is the study of governments, public policies and political behaviours. Politics affects us all in our daily lives. It is easy to think of issues that we all have opinions about. Should the government tax the rich to try to achieve greater equality? Should it introduce ‘green taxes’ in order to protect the environment? How high a priority should development aid be? What are the causes and consequences of ‘Brexit’? Questions such as these, along with analysis of political systems, political behaviour, international relations and how democracy works, are at the heart of the study of political science.The study of politics as an academic subject involves, among other things, thinking about how these decisions get made. If it is not possible to keep everyone happy, whose views should prevail and why? If governments do not always make what seems to be the most ‘rational’ decision on economic policy, why not? How much say do ordinary people have in policy-making, and is it feasible to make the decision making process more open? Other big questions we study include issues such as: why don’t democracies go to war with each other? Why do civil wars last so long and why are ethnic conflicts more difficult to resolve then other forms of conflict?Political Science will appeal to students who are excited about exploring the background to current events, the nature and use of power and how decisions are made that impact on wider society. If you are interested in having an in-depth knowledge of public affairs, developing critical and much sought after research skills and if your career interests lie in journalism, public service, teaching, public policy, international organisation and/or business then Political Science may be for you.Trinity’s Department of Political Science, in the School of Social Sciences and Philosophy, is ranked in the top 100 in the world for Politics and International Studies (QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2020). Political Science has been an important part of the curriculum since 1855 and Trinity has developed an international reputation for its research work on the European Union, comparative politics, comparative public opinion, international relations as well as democracy and development.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours.There are careers for which a demonstrated interest in politics and advanced research skills are a definite plus and will give you a real head start. Journalism, finance, the civil service, public relations, business, and work in international organisations and not-for-profit organisations, all come into this category. A demonstrated knowledge of how the world works is obviously an asset for many types of career. In addition, Political Science students develop exceptional communication, writing and critical thinking skills which are highly sought after by employers. An increasing number of graduates go on to do further postgraduate study.Please see the individual course descriptions for Philosophy, Political Science, Economics and Sociology (P.P.E.S.), Business, Economic and Social Studies (B.E.S.S.) and Joint Honours pages for History, Geography and Law for the Joint Honours courses offered with Political Science.Introduction to Political Science, Introduction to Sociology, Introduction to EconomicsHistory of Political Thought, International Relations, Comparative PoliticsThe following is a list of the modules typically on offer: Research Methods, Irish Politics, Democracy and Development, European Union Politics, Political Institutions of the US, Political Psychology, Political Violence, Political Theory: Contemporary Topics, Issues in Contemporary Politics, Contemporary International Relations, African Politics, Autocracy, Economic Inequality and Democracy. If you would like more detailed information on all the modules offered, please visit: www.tcd.ie/political_science/ undergraduate/module-outlinesClick here for further information on modules/subject.Some courses are examined by a combination of assessed essays and formal examination; some others are assessed through coursework only. Normally, each course has two hours of lectures and one tutorial per week. In fourth year, students specialising in Political Science will have the opportunity to research and undertake a Capstone research project on a topic of their choice. Final year classes are typically run as small group seminars.The Department of Political Science is a partner in Erasmus exchanges with the Institut d’ Études Politiques in Strasbourg and Paris, the University of Zurich, the University of Bologna and the University of Mannheim. Students taking Political Science as a subject in Joint Honours may also go abroad on an exchange administered by other departments, subject to approval of their course of study abroad by the Department of Political Science. In addition there are opportunities for students to go on one of several international exchanges. These are open to all students on a University-wide basis.

It includes topics such as infant and child development, perception, learning, motivation, cognitive processes (like memory and problem solving), individual differences and social psychology, and has many of the features of a science course, such as practical work, statistical description and analysis of data and courses on the underlying physiology of the human brain.The School of Psychology aims to offer a knowledge base and a set of skills that not only equip students for the many careers that exist in psychology, but also prepare students intellectually for other careers.Psychology is a branch of science that demands clear, rigorous thinking, numeracy and the ability to define, study and solve problems in complex, changing settings. It is also an applied science that deals with how people act and behave in the real world and provides support for people in their social life and work, for example, through clinical and counselling interventions. If you are interested in the factors influencing human thinking, feeling and behaviour you will enjoy this course.Trinity’s School of Psychology is ranked in the top 150 universities for Psychology in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2020. As well as offering high-quality teaching, the school collaborates with a number of other disciplines through Trinity College Institute for Neuroscience, the Trinity Centre for Global Health, and the Trinity Centre for Innovative Human Systems.Students are encouraged to become actively involved in our ongoing research, particularly in the third and fourth years of their studies. The Single Honours degree confers eligibility for graduate membership of the Psychological Society of Ireland and provide the basis for entry to postgraduate programmes, such as those in clinical psychology and counselling psychology.Many psychology graduates proceed to a career in professional psychology through professional training. The School of Psychology itself offers a range of postgraduate programmes including professional doctorates in Clinical Psychology and Counselling Psychology, Masters courses in Applied Psychology, Applied Behaviour Analysis and Clinical Supervision, as well as online postgraduate qualifications in Managing Risk and System Change, the M.Phil./P.Grad.Dip Psychoanalytic Studies and research M.Sc. and PhD degrees. However, the advanced understanding of human behaviour and experience and the wide range of skills developed during the course have allowed students to enter many professions, ranging from management, marketing, advertising and accountancy, to journalism, broadcast media, teaching and recruitment. Seminars about career development will be provided by the school during the course of your degree.The course is designed to develop a wide knowledge of the concepts, principles, theories and research methods of contemporary psychology; to develop skills of analysis and synthesis, research design, statistical description and evaluation, problem-solving and computer use; to provide practice in the design, execution, reporting and assessment of research and to develop competence in group work, communication and presentation skills and self-assessment.During the lecture term, Single Honours students spend approximately 10-12 hours per week receiving tuition such as lectures, tutorials, seminars and laboratory practicals.As a first and second year student, you will take foundation-level modules in a range of areas such as: Foundations in Psychology; Social Psychology; Perception; Psychological Disorder; Developmental Psychology; Cognition and the Brain, the Psychology of Language; Thinking; Fundamentals of Neuroscience and Behaviour; Evolutionary Psychology; Personality and Individual Differences; Research methods and Statistical Analysis.You will also be given the opportunity to take modules from other programmes across the university.By third year you will have identified areas within psychology that are of particular interest to you and you will have the opportunity to develop these interests throughout third and fourth year, by choosing modules from a series of advanced options.On completion of the course, students must have taken at least one module from each of the five specified thematic areas (Biological, Social, Developmental, Cognitive, and Personality and Individual Differences).The type of modules which have been offered within each of these areas include: Biological: Neurological Rehabilitation; Preclinical and Clinical Models of Neuropsychiatric and Neurological Disorders; The Brain Throughout the Lifespan; Case studies in Neuropsychology; Making Sense of Action; Social: Social Neuroscience; Advanced Psychology of Language; Moral Development in Childhood; Human Factors and Organisational Factors; Social Psychology and Discourse; Developmental: Child Development in Changing Family Contexts; Applied Issues in Developmental Psychology; Child and Adolescent Clinical Psychology; Child Health and Well-being Cognitive: Human Reasoning; Creative Cognition; Development of Perception Throughout the Lifespan; Perceptual Neuroscience; Personality and individual differences: Health Psychology; Psychology of Criminal Behaviour; Clinical Psychology and Intellectual DisabilitiesIn fourth year a large part of your workload involves carrying out an independent Capstone project under the supervision of a member of staff. Many students report that this project, while challenging, is one of the most rewarding parts of the course.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.A combination of end-of-semester written examinations and continuous assessment is used. In your final year, you will also undertake a Capstone project.Second and third-year undergraduates are eligible to apply to study for one or more semesters (usually a whole academic year) in certain other European psychology schools, with travel, and, where appropriate, some subsistence funding provided by the EU Erasmus fund. There are no basic course charges to be paid abroad. Assessment is carried out in the host (i.e., international) institution and is accepted by Trinity as if students were examined here. The School of Psychology has bilateral agreements with several European universities, including the University of Helsinki, Freie Universität Berlin, Erasmus University Rotterdam and Université Paris V.",

We define ‘public history’ and ‘cultural heritage’ broadly. The course involves analysis of cultural memory, its construction, reception and loss; and study of the public status and consumption of history in modern society. Political issues surrounding public commemoration and ‘sites of memory’ are examined and the role of museums, galleries and the media in shaping public perceptions of the past is considered. The course also surveys the more concrete questions involved in the conservation, presentation and communication of the physical heritage of past cultures, particularly where interpretation and meaning are contested. The course is taught in collaboration with the leading cultural institutions located in Dublin and several organisations offer internships to students. In recent years participating bodies have included Dublin City Gallery; Dublin City Library and Archive; Glasnevin Trust; Hugh Lane Gallery; The Little Museum of Dublin; Marsh’s Library; the National Gallery of Ireland; the National Library of Ireland; the National Museum of Ireland; and St Patrick’s Cathedral. In a variety of modules, students are trained in the analysis and the presentation of their research findings. They are also introduced to the methodological challenges of advanced study and research at postgraduate level. The course comprises a core module, entitled Remembering, Reminding and Forgetting: Public History, Cultural Heritage and the Shaping of the Past, which runs across both terms. A suite of term-long electives is available on substantive themes. A three-month internship, located in one of our collaborating institutions, runs throughout the second term. Practitioner workshops are also held in the second term and provide an opportunity for national and international ‘public historians’ to discuss their work with the class. In any given year this may include novelists, artists, museum directors, or heritage and tourism policymakers. The course concludes with the production of a dissertation or major project, individually supervised by an member of staff.The MPhil helps prepare graduates for a wide variety of careers including in the museum and heritage sectors, libraries and archives, public policy and administration, teaching, media. It also provides invaluable training in research for those planning to pursue a doctorate and/or career in research. Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "Religion plays a significant role in diverse cultural, social and political contexts. Religious world-views, values and symbols play a critical role in shaping cultural norms, traditions and practices. This is the case both in religiously plural contexts, as well as those dominated by particular traditions. The contours of religion are evident not only in the artefacts that transmit a culture’s heritage (such as architecture, visual arts, illuminated manuscripts, literature, etc.), but also in contemporary debates about the evolving identities of societies in a world characterised by religious pluralism.Students on this course will be engaged with contemporary debates about, for example, the nature and impact of political religion, religion and modernity, religion and gender, religion and violence, religion and human rights, and ethics in politics.This course offers you a broad-based study of Religion and Theology. Within the Cultural Study of Religion, you have the opportunity to explore the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the religions of Asia and Africa, as well new atheistic and religious movements. With Theological Studies, you can investigate the development of Christian self-understanding in a number of different modes, from historical movements to contemporary theological projects engaged with liberation, postcoloniality, justice, gender, interreligious conversation, and the environment.In combining theological study with the study of religion, this degree is unique in Ireland. Trinity’s School of Religion is internationally recognised for its strengths in biblical studies, philosophical and theological ethics, peace studies, theological studies and religious studies. These strengths ensure that student experience combines in-depth analysis with breadth of subject matter that presents religious traditions in their historical, intellectual, cultural, aesthetic, political and ethical dimensions, as well as examining how religious traditions have interacted, and continue to interact, with the context of their origins and development.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours. There may also be an opportunity to take this subject up as a New Minor Subject from second year.This course offers students the opportunity to develop all four of Trinity’s graduate attributes of thinking independently, communicating effectively, developing continuously and acting responsibly. Graduates from our School have entered a wide range of professions, including: law, education (primary and secondary), information technology, pastoral ministry, the civil service, creative arts, publishing, accountancy, as well as continuing on to further research in Ireland and abroad.In your first year of study, twelve modules help to immerse you in this field of scholarship. The Hebrew Bible, and the New Testament – are introduced in their historical contexts. You will study Judaism, Islam, the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, religious diversity in Asian contexts. You will be introduced to ethics, philosophy and the study of religion, as well as theology through an engagement with some of their major thinkers, texts and methods. Before moving into your second year, you will be invited to consider the direction that you would like to pursue in your studies over the coming years in each specialism of the course.Throughout these years, your modules offer an increasingly focused and state-of-the art engagement in your chosen field. Different genres of literature and historical reconstruction are addressed in biblical studies. Theology looks both to the emergence and reception of classical doctrines, as well as to topical issues of religion and science, and theology and social justice. The field of ethics is explored through issues of gender and human rights, bioethics, technology, environment and war and peace. There is an opportunity to study the Qur’an within Islamic and Late Antiquity contexts, and explore the message and heritage of the prophet Muhammad. During these years it is also possible for you to study Hebrew or Greek.The major accomplishment of your final year is your Capstone project – an individual research project. This is an important achievement of supervised and self-directed research and writing. In addition to the Capstone research project, final year modules offer you the opportunity to engage with current issues of research activity within the school. These areas currently include: religion, war and peace; multiple modernities; theologies of church and eucharist; the study of ritual; queer theological ethics; religion and the arts; Islamic perceptions of gender.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.This degree is also available within the Dual BA Programme between Trinity College Dublin and Columbia University. The range of assessment strategies reflects the goal of enhancing student education through diversity and quality of experience. Some modules are assessed by end-of-semester exams combined with summative essays; others rely exclusively on essays; others require the creation of a portfolio of short assignments; others include in-class tests.Students in the School of Religion, Theology, and Peace Studies may avail of opportunities to study abroad or in K.U.

        "Overview": "At the beginning of the twelfth century western Christendom had a new optimism: a commercial and urban boom, new religious orders, new church buildings, the codification of religious law, a flourishing of religious art, a movement to “recover” the Holy Land. Between 1250 and 1500 war, plague and religious dissent had a profound impact on European life. This module offers a thematic survey of religious practices and the impact of religion on society more generally in the central and later medieval west, where everyday life was carried on to a soundtrack of church bells and sermons, but where the culture allowed for a surprising amount of diversity of belief and practice as well. Lectures and tutorials focus on the practice and impact of religion in medieval society, on social structures (such as family and community) and on relations with other cultures.Lecturer: Professor Ruth Karras.How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ after 16 August for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.

        "Overview": "Russian is the first language of nearly 150 million people; it is spoken by more than 260 million people around the world and is one of Europe’s most important languages. Russia is a significant force in present-day geopolitics and a major player in the global economy, with ties both to Europe and to Asia, and beyond. Russian writers, musicians and artists have made a considerable contribution to European culture; Russian history has helped shape Europe as we know it today. Exploring Russia’s past and present helps understand the interaction between Europe’s eastern and western traditions.You will find the Russian programme exciting and rewarding if you enjoy language study, are interested in unfamiliar cultures, have a sense of adventure and are not afraid of a challenge.Trinity is the only university in Ireland where you have the opportunity to study Russian to degree level. The scale of the Department of Russian and Slavonic Studies is such that we are able to give students a considerable amount of individual attention and support, and students are able to tailor the programme to develop their particular interests and skills, and to bridge the gaps between the study of Russian and the student’s other area(s) of study.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours. There may also be an opportunity to take this subject up as a New Minor Subject from second year.Career paths followed by recent graduates are often ones where Russian-language competence is directly relevant. These include arts and media; education; business, finance and marketing; civil and public service; international organisations (UN, EU, NGOs) and diplomacy; journalism and tourism. Alternatively, each year several graduates will opt to pursue further postgraduate study in Ireland or abroad.Advanced knowledge of a less-studied language like Russian, as well as the transferable skills (analytical and critical thinking, written and oral presentation skills) you will acquire in the study of the history, culture and literature of Russia, is generally a very attractive combination for prospective employers, even for career paths where Russian may not be directly involved in your day-to-day work.At entry, Russian must be combined with one other subject. In later years, you will be able to select additional subjects and electivesMost students start Russian as complete beginners, and take an intensive first-year language course (with six hours of language classes per week). Special provisions are made for students with prior knowledge of Russian (native, near-native speakers, those who have passed Russian in the Leaving Certificate or have taken another entrance qualification in Russian).In addition to language study, you will take modules covering aspects of Russian literature, Russian history and Russian culture, society and politics. In later years, you will also have the option to study a second Slavonic language (Polish, Bulgarian or Croatian).In the first and second years, classes cover three main areas:In the first and second years, there are approximately ten hours of classes per week, divided between language work and literary, cultural and area studies.In addition to advanced language study, the third and fourth years of your course offer a wider range of module choices, allowing you to choose options that reflect your own particular interests. These include more specialised study of Russian literature and culture, history of Russia and the Soviet Union, Russian society and politics, and a second Slavonic language (Bulgarian, Croatian or Polish). If you elect to study Russian in your final year, you will also undertake a Capstone project on a subject of your own choice.At all levels, you will be assessed by a combination of continuous assessment and exams. We use a mix of traditional and innovative continuous assessment methods: essays, project work, presentations, book reviews and dossiers, podcast creation. Language modules are traditionally assessed by written, oral and aural examinations. Final year students also write a Capstone project.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.A year or semester studying abroad is one of the highlights of a student’s Trinity experience, and immersing oneself in the language and culture is also one of the most valuable ways of achieving fluency when you are studying a language. Single Honours students have a compulsory third year of study abroad and other students are encouraged to spend a year or a semester in their third year in one of our partner universities. At a minimum, you will be required to spend two months in a Russian-speaking country prior to taking your final exams. We currently have exchange agreements with Moscow State University as well as close connections with other universities and institutes in Moscow, St Petersburg and in a number of provincial towns.",

        "Overview": "The growth and development of cities in the 21st Century presents significant challenges,including sustainable development, the planning and design of urban space and socialwellbeing. With thousands of smart-city initiatives around the world, smart urbanism is nowone of the dominant models of urban development. Projects for smart cities involve theregeneration of existing urban areas as well as the creation of large new settlements, and havea major positive impact on the many environmental, social and economic systems thatunderpin the planet. Meanwhile, and with a strong overlap with smart city initiatives, citiesaround the world are reacting to broader environmental challenges, such as climate changethrough measures aimed at developing sustainable solutions. The global scale of suchchallenges has been recognized within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) under theheading of ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’. Here, the promotion of safe, inclusive andsustainable cities is outlined as a central pillar of creating a sustainable urban future.Smart-city initiatives have a multi-dimensional nature. As projects that are aimed at improvingurban spaces, they are deeply connected to issues of urbanisation and urban planning.Moreover, projects for smart cities involve the production of a number of technologies such aswireless sensor networks designed to produce data on how the city operates, and innovativeefficient or low-waste electrical grids. Therefore, because of their focus on technologicalinnovation, the development of smart cities goes beyond the science of the city and is also theproduct of studies in computer science and engineering. Finally, once implemented, smartinterventions take place not upon a blank canvas, but rather within complex ecological andsocial systems whose dynamics must be taken into account, in order to avoid environmentaldegradation and biodiversity loss.Particularly in terms of sustainability, the multi-dimensional nature of smart-city initiatives canbe understood only through an interdisciplinary approach. This new MSc in Smart andSustainable Cities approaches the study of smart and sustainable urbanism by drawing from theresearch-based expertise of leading scholars from Trinity’s Energy, Environment and EmergingTechnologies Institute (E3). The programme, which is the first dedicated programme of its kind,will provide students with an in-depth understanding of smart and sustainable cities, using (a)the tools of urban geography and planning to examine the spatial formation of smart cities; (b)methods in engineering and computer science to analyze the functions and applications ofsmart technologies, and (c) insights from ecology to explore the environmental impact of both‘smart-city projects’ and wider transformations of contemporary cities. The programme is thusof interest to a wide range of students from different backgrounds. Career options aftergraduation include working in urban planning and in the private sector engaged in smart cityinitiatives.Course StructureThe M.Sc. in Smart and Sustainable Cities will be delivered full-time over one year. The course comprises 8 compulsory modules, carrying 5 ECTS credits each, and a Dissertation module carrying 30 ECTS credits. In addition, students also take a total of 20 ECTS of optional credits to give a total 90 ECTS for the course, as outlined below:Core (compulsory modules)• Urban Governance• Smart Eco-Cities of the Future• Geographical Information Systems (GIS)• Urban Sustainability• Introduction to Machine Learning• Research Method• Fieldtrip• Placement• DissertationOptions (choose 4)• Transportation Policy• Transportation Modelling & Planning• Energy Policy & Building Energy Demand• Urban Computing• Artificial Intelligence• Machine Learning• Environmental Policies• Human Interaction with Biodiversity• Climate Justice, Climate Change & DevelopmentThe programme draws upon existing modules within the Schools of Computer Science, Engineering and Natural Sciences as well as introducing new, core modules exclusive to this masters. For some of the optional modules, pre-requisites apply and admission is dependent on getting the module coordinator’s approval, based on prior education and experience.FieldtripThe course will have a mandatory field trip to one of three alternating European cities. This allows students to gain insights into the ways in which different approaches emerge within specific social, political and economic contexts in which they are embedded. The fieldtrip will alternate between: London, as exemplifying the connections between global transformations and urbanization; Amsterdam as a prototype of sustainable urban living, and; Brussels as a city that provides insights into the connections between urban governance and sustainabilityPlacementThe course will incorporate a mandatory industrial in-company placement module. The placement is designed to allow students to link their in-class learning to hands-on approaches within a particular sub-area of smart cities and urban sustainability. This will be achieved both through the experience of the work placement itself and through the completion of a report, which will form the majority of the coursework on this module (80%). Students will be expected to seek out and secure their own placements. However, students will be given assistance in finding relevant organizations.This course is designed to meet the learning needs of students who want to enter an expansive but demanding employment market, preparing them for professional work in institutions and public or private companies, in the field of Smart and Sustainable Cities. Graduates have pursued careers in urban planning and in the private sector engaged in smart city initiatives.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "The overall objective of this programme is to provide graduates from all disciplines with the opportunity to develop their understanding of the role of social policy in developing healthy functioning societies. Student will get to grips with some of the ‘wicked problems’ that contemporary societies face. These are complex interdependent problems such as crime and poverty which are often resistant to the solutions put in place by governments. Students will understand the arguments for developing social policy in areas such as social security, health, housing and personal social services and the challenges of implementing and changing policy in these areas. This course will provide students with a stimulating online learning experience by creating a structured yet flexible learning approach. The place of study will be totally flexible as online delivery allows students to engage in many learning activities at home or in the workplace. The programme will appeal to those responsible for developing, delivering and administering social policies and social services as well as those involved in advocating for policy and service change. It will be or particular interest to graduates with an undergraduate qualification outside of the social science and social studies field wishing to pursue a Masters programme in that field. The Postgraduate Diploma will act as a conversion course for such graduates and would enhance their application to pursue further study on a specialised programme such as the Masters of Social Work. The programme will also appeal to applicants from other countries, especially outside the EU, and in North America who will have the opportunity to study in Ireland’s leading university with expertise in Irish, EU and international social policy. The Postgraduate Diploma in Social Policy and Practice is offered as a one year online programme with students taking modules totalling 60 ECTS comprising seven core modules.Our graduates have found employment as social workers in Ireland and internationally, in sectors including TUSLA, Child and Family Agency, Probation Service, Health-Related Social Work, Mental Health Services, Disability Services and Community Development. Others have chosen careers in research, advocacy, service management and education and training.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "The B.S.S. is a professional degree designed for students who wish to become social workers and who believe they have the personal attributes and motivation for social work.This degree combines an academic social science degree with professional social work training. B.S.S. degree graduates are eligible to apply for registration with CORU (Irish Social Work Registration Board) and once registered can access employment in a wide range of social work posts in Ireland. Graduates can also apply for registration in the UK and internationally.Social work is a profession concerned with supporting and helping people in a variety of situations and settings. People who use social work services include young and adult offenders, children, families, older people, people with mental and physical illness and disability, homeless people, unemployed people, ethnic groups, Travellers and people with drug and alcohol problems. Ultimately, social work aims to support people to live more successfully, within their communities, by helping them to find solutions to their problems.Social Studies could be the right course for you if you wish to work in a caring and challenging profession. Most importantly, it is the right course for you if you have the ability to problem solve, a willingness to make challenging decisions alongside a strong desire to effect positive change.This is one of only two undergraduate programmes in Ireland which qualifies students to a professional level in social work. A qualification in the area of social work has been taught in Trinity since 1934, making it Ireland’s oldest and most internationally renowned social work programme.The small class size ensures that there is a friendly relationship between staff and students that is based on mutual respect. The degree programme which is accredited by CORU combines teaching on a range of social science subjects alongside work placements. The Social Studies degree is an interesting and intensive programme which aims to help you become a reflective and proactive professional social worker who will make a significant contribution to society.As a Social Studies graduate of Trinity, you are eligible to apply to register as a professionally qualified social worker with CORU. Your qualification will be recognised in many other countries. You also have a good Social Science degree that allows you to move into policy, media, research or NGO project work. As a social worker, you can continue your professional development through postgraduate courses and can move into management, research or training.This course introduces you to a wide range of social science subjects in the first year, and then increases the number of social work subjects in the following three years. Teaching methods are varied, interactive and draw on your personal and practical experience. Assessment includes written examinations, essays, case studies, projects, and placement reports.First year subjects include Introduction to Social Work, Psychology, Social Policy, Sociology, Economic Policy and Political Science. Optional courses in either French or German are also available. In first year, there are approximately 13-15 hours in lectures, 3-4 hours in tutorial classes and several hours in the library each week. If you have had no relevant practical experience before starting the degree, we ask you to do 30 hours (2-3 hours per week) volunteer work during first year to build your practical experience and help you to apply what you are learning to a real-world situation. First year students are also provided with the opportunity to undertake a six-week placement related to the course (see below for further details).In second year, core subjects are Social Work Theory and Practice, Law for Social Workers, Social Policy, Psychology and Social Research. The social work modules involve field trips to relevant organisations and services. In addition, students undertake a ten-week placement during this academic year.Third and fourth year subjects include: Family and Child Care Studies; Social Policy; Sociology; Mental Health; Equality Issues; Group Work; Human Rights Law as well as Social Work Theory and Practice, including counselling skills and practice workshops.Click here for further information on modules/subject.In each of the four years you will have a placement in a different social service agency, under the supervision of an experienced practitioner. These placements provide you with practical experience and an opportunity to apply and develop the skills and knowledge that you have acquired at Trinity.Placements are arranged in settings such as child and family welfare teams, hospital social work departments, child and family centres, probation service and community development projects. They account for approximately 30% of your course time (220 days) over the four years and take place at the end of each of the first and second years and mostly in term time in the third and fourth years.

        "Overview": "Sociology studies the interaction of people within social groups like families, schools and companies and how this shapes their behaviours and life chances. It explores questions such as: why do migrants develop their cultural identities in different ways? How is privacy changing with the rise of digital technologies? How does a child’s family of origin shape their chances of educational success and future job? Do state rules and regulations represent and protect elite power? Sociology is foremost among the social sciences in its understanding of social changeIf you want to understand the social changes taking place in the world today, and you are curious about people and society, then Sociology is for you. You will also gain the ability to understand topical issues and to present and communicate information and thoughts coherently. In addition, you will learn invaluable analytical, communication, research and presentation skills – transferable skills which can be applied to a wide range of careers and postgraduate programmes.There has been a rich tradition of sociological education at Trinity since the 1960s. The department is committed to advancing the understanding of society and to igniting the passion of our students through exceptional teaching and research. The Sociology Department is in the top 150 in the world (QS World University Rankings by Subject, 2020). The Department of Sociology is internationally known for its work on education and employment, migration, identities, social inequalities, conflict and digital lives. The department has won several teaching awards – both for postgraduates and staff – for outstanding contribution in the pursuit of teaching excellence.As a recent graduate put it, Sociology explains how the great thinkers predicted the ills of modern society from social isolation to empty hospital wards. It questions the future of whether India can and will become the next China, and whether the internet will undermine traditional communities. It explains the underlying reasons why European societies are culturally so different. It tackles the big social issues of conflict, race, migration, gender and popular culture. It teaches you how to understand, research and explain all of these topics in a logical, organised fashion.Sociology graduates find that their broad training and appreciation of how society and people work means they can thrive in careers in the media, journalism, consulting, academia and teaching, policy analysis, non-governmental organisations, management, and advisory roles in the public service. Graduates are working for organisations as diverse as Goodbody Stockbrokers, the ESRI, the European Parliament, Citibank, RTÉ, Google, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise Ireland.Our modules cover Ireland, the wider European society, the non-European world and the global arena. The first two years are more general and foundational in nature while the third and fourth years are characterised by smaller, more intimate classes that attempt to challenge you intellectually and encourage problem solving and critical thinking skills.Sociology teaching in the first and second years emphasises the understanding of the basic principles of sociology and the acquisition of both quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary for more in-depth study. In first year, you are introduced to the distinctive questions that sociologists ask about human society, and the theories and concepts used in the search for answers. You have approximately 6 hours of lectures and 3 hours of tutorials per week in Sociology.In the second year, you study issues around gender, work and family; power, state and social movements, and are introduced to sociological research methods and theorySpecialisation in sociological topic areas, and more advanced analysis, research and presentation skills are provided in the third and fourth years. In your third year, you learn about Globalisation and Development; Comparative Sociology of Europe; Race, Ethnicity and Identity; Social Stratification and Inequalities, and carry out research projects involving analysis of both numerical data from surveys, and verbal data that are the outcomes of recorded interviews and focus groups. The fourth year offers modules in a variety of topic areas, including Digital Lives and Social Networks; Labour Markets, Gender and Institutions; Migration, Mobilities and Integration, and Conflict Studies. You have the opportunity to carry out your own independent Capstone research project from start to finish on a topic of your choice (recent projects included: Immigration and the prison system, Unmarried fathers’ participation in their children’s lives, and Counterurbanisation in the Irish countryside). Many students find this a great asset when talking to employers and applying for jobs.Modules are examined by a combination of continuous assessment including essays, portfolios, individual and group presentations, and the formal end-of-semester examination. In addition, students specialising exclusively in sociology in their final year complete a Capstone project.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.Around one third of our undergraduate students participate in Erasmus and non-EU international exchanges. You may participate in full-year or half-year exchanges with the following partner institutions: Sorbonne University (France), University Lille 1 (France), Charles University Prague (Czech Republic), Umea University (Sweden), University of Copenhagen (Denmark), University of Helsinki (Finland), University of Malta (Malta), Istanbul Bogazici University (Turkey), Utrecht University (Netherlands), Ludwig Maximilian University Munich (Germany). In addition, you can compete for a smaller number of places on university-wide non-European exchanges with partners in Australia, Singapore, China, Japan, Hong Kong, Brazil, Canada and the USA in your third year.

        "Overview": "Who is this Micro-credential for? • The games industry in Ireland is also growing, with several start-ups and AAA game developers setting up base in Ireland. Spatial audio is a critical component of both gaming, and new mediums such as VR/AR. The needs therefore addressed by this micro-credential include; • Upskilling to adapt to new audio formats and standards used in media such as VR, AR, and 360 video, or new spatial audio streaming formats such as Dolby Atmos.• Utilizing spatial audio recording and analysis techniques for acoustic engineering and analysis.Why should I take this Micro-credential? • Spatial audio has seen renewed interest in recent years due to its critical importance in new immersive media such as VR, AR, and 360 video. New immersive cinema surround-sound formats such as Dolby Atmos have also recently been adopted by streaming media platforms such as Apple Music, Netflix, among others. • The recording, production, and formatting of spatial audio for these different platforms and applications involve a range of different audio techniques such as binaural and ambisonics, which are significantly more complex and fundamentally different from standard two-channel stereo.• This micro-credential will allow audio practitioners to upskill to these new audio formats and standards used in media such as VR, AR, and 360 video, and new spatial audio streaming formats such as Dolby Atmos, utilizing spatial audio recording and analysis techniques for acoustic engineering and analysis.• Our Micro-credentials are all CPD approved by Engineers IrelandWhen can I start this Micro-credential? • There is one intake per year in JanuaryWhat do I need to be accepted onto this Micro-credential? – Entry requirements & Prerequisite documents • Experience with the fundamentals of audio production and recording using DAWs is a pre-requisite for this micro-credential. Some basic experience with the DAW Reaper is also desirable, but not required.• 2.1 grade in a level 8 degree in Engineering, Music/Media Technology, Music, or cognate disciplines• CVWhat will I learn?• This micro-credential addresses the fundamental psychoacoustics behind techniques such as stereophony, ambisonics, and binaural to reveal how they function, and importantly their relative strengths and limitations. • In addition, the practical production of audio content using these techniques will be addressed using a variety of different tools and applications. • Finally, the use of spatial audio techniques for acoustics analysis and engineering will also be examined using a variety of practical examples.What will I do? • In this micro-credential you will attend weekly 2-hour lectures. These will be classroom based due to the significant practical component involving spatial audio loudspeaker systems, microphones, and other tools and software. • The lectures will include the theory and practice of various spatial audio techniques, using both lecture style presentations, listening sessions with various spatial audio content, and practical, studio-based tutorials.How will this Micro-credential be delivered? • The lecture component of this micro-credential will occupy a single 2-hour slot, once a week for the 12 weeks of the autumn semester and is therefore relatively accessible for industry and professional staff participation.How is this Micro-credential assessed? • It will be assessed through two practical assignments, and one in-class MCQ test in Week 8 of the course. The first assignment is in the first half of the course and concentrates on binaural audio. The second, larger assignment is due c. 2 weeks after the final lecture and students can select one of three projects.• Option A: 5.1 Location Music RecordingObject: Produce a location music recording for 5.1 using various multichannel microphone techniques.• Option B: Spatial Music CompositionObject: Compose an original work of spatial music for 7.1 using Higher Order Ambisonics, B-format recordings, Stereophony and Parameter Modulation in Reaper.• Option C: Acoustics Survey and FOA IR captureObject: Perform an on location acoustic survey using monophonic and first order Ambisonic (FOA) microphones and prepare FOA spatial IRs and example binaural audio files.

        "Overview": "Speech processing is the science concerned with how speech communication works: how speech is produced by the speaker and understood by the listener. It is also concerned with how these processes can be analysed and modelled, and with how these models can be used to develop technologies that also produce and understand speech (synthetic voices, speech recognisers). The science and technology involved are fundamental to the understanding and remediation of disordered speech. The science of speech is thus at the intersection of many disciplines, particularly linguistics, psychology, acoustics, and engineering.Language processing, in parallel, deals with computational theories of grammar and meaning, and provides access to fundamentals of linguistics as a science and as an engineering discipline. As a science, it is concerned with the fact that language is used as a medium for thought as well as for communication. As an engineering discipline, it is concerned with tools that work: predictive text in telephones, automated personal assistants, web search, and so on. The fact that you are reading this sentence entails that you have taken advantage of one or more language technologies; it would not be visible to you otherwise. The fact that you understand this sentence (or any sentence) begs all of the questions of cognitive science such as what “meanings” are and how people reason with them.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Our students come from many backgrounds. Some have a background in language study, some have an interest in clinical speech and language analysis, some have a background in psychology, computer science or engineering. In general, they are people who have an analytical bent (they may be interested in how dialects differ, they may love crossword puzzles or find legal reasoning entertaining) and wish to know more about what makes human language work.Our alumni have followed various career paths, with many opting to pursue research at a higher level through the Ph.D., in CLCS (e.g., becoming involved in research projects in the Phonetics and Speech Lab), with the computational linguists in TCD's School of Computer Science and Statistics, and in other leading institutions, internationally. Some have also used this course as a foundation to enter Speech Therapy programmes in Ireland and abroad.For more information be sure to visit the course website, and don’t forget to read the Frequently Asked Questions.

        "Overview": "The aim of this MSc course is to allow participants commence entry level training or further their existing career progression in musculoskeletal and sports and exercise medicine by enhancing basic background knowledge in anatomy, exercise physiology, sports and exercise science; and, in addition develop high quality research, practical and critical thinking skills in musculoskeletal assessment, rehabilitation planning, and exercise testing and prescription in health and disease. Students will achieve this through a tiered process starting with three basic science modules; Anatomy, Exercise Physiology; and Research Methods in Semester 1. In anatomy students will enhance their knowledge of musculoskeletal and neuroanatomy through instructor lead pro-section based practical classes and personal dissection projects; and, in lectures revisit the organisation of the central and peripheral nervous systems concerned with the control of human movement and/or relevant to sports related injury and assessment. In the exercise physiology module, learning focuses on the key systems for sports and physical activity; energy systems, muscle, cardiovascular and respiratory systems; and whole-body hormonal and homeostatic responses to physical activity, exercise and training. In the research methods module students will develop skills necessary to critically evaluate published research, formulate a research question and design a high-quality research project, from initial statistical modelling, ethics application, and power analysis, through data collection, data handling, and statistical analysis; and finally enabling writing of a scientific report worthy of submission as a journal article or critical review. The research methods module runs in parallel and supports the research dissertation component which runs over the entire academic year.In the second semester the focus shifts to clinical and applied aspects during clinical sports and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal assessment, imaging and rehabilitation and exercise science modules. In these modules students will develop necessary entry level knowledge, core competencies and skills in musculoskeletal assessment, rehabilitation and exercise laboratory testing. Modules cover aspects of team and individual athlete care within different sports reflective of the course participants, and physical activity and health in the generally active population or those with chronic disease. Critical thinking skills are developed in instructor lead clinical case scenario-based teaching and student led clinical case presentations and modular seminars review current literature to demonstrate the scope of problems encountered in day-to-day care of athletes and teams, and the physically active of all ages and gender.This M.Sc. in Sports and Exercise Medicine is delivered fulltime and in one academic year and is comprised of six taught modules (60 ECTS) and a research project (30 ECTS). All course material will wherever possible be presented by a core instructor group in face-to-face lecture, workshop, seminars and practical class-based formats on campus for which students are expected to fully attend. In especially the second semester some clinician lead lectures will be delivered on-line. There are two teaching semesters and then the final semester three (May-August) is devoted to research project data collection and report write up for submission in late August. Each semester is split into two 6-week teaching blocks per semester (with a one-week mid-term break); and each teaching week generally runs from 11am on Mondays through to lunchtime on Fridays in each week. Please note, if further COVID19 variants arise some elements of course delivery; didactic elements, student presentations and assessments may be run ‘on-line’. All students will be required to have a PC or Mac computer with large RAM capability and at least 4-6 GB storage capacity to allow use of large statistical data analysis packages such as SPSS; and, Zoom or Teams functionality in order to attend ‘live streamed’ sessions and for remote learning of ‘on-line’ course delivery.All students who complete six taught modules but do not complete the research project write up according to college calendar timelines will be eligible for an exit award of Post-graduate Diploma in Sports and Exercise Medicine. In order to achieve the award of MSc in Sports and Exercise Medicine, students must complete all six taught modules (60 ECTS) and the research dissertation component (30 ECTS) within one year.This course is designed to produce leaders in sports medicine. Graduates have pursued diverse careers in multi-disciplinary teams within the HSE, and in sport and exercise at all levels.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.",

        "Overview": "In this module, we discuss how Europe was defined and redefined through war, military occupation, civil conflicts, and peace agreements in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Drawing on examples of various—through often interrelated—conflicts, we discuss several major questions: How did international and civil conflicts shape European culture and politics? Why was the twentieth century so violent? How did Europe become divided into “right” and “left,” and “East” and “West”? How are these conflicts and political extremes remembered or forgotten today? Comparing writings and films from across the continent, including Britain, Poland, Spain, Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany, we ask how the map of the continent has changed over the past century and whether it is possible to write a single history of Europe.Lecturers: Dr Molly Pucci; Dr Patrick Houlihan How to Apply: Please check our website https://www.histories-humanities.tcd.ie/shortcourses/ after 16 August for updates on enrolment dates and term dates.

        "Overview": "Students who wish to study Zoology for their degree apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences Stream (TR060) and may select Zoology as their specialist subject for the 3rd and 4th years at the end of the second year.Zoology is the study of living animals and their relationship with their environment. As the need for an understanding of complex biosystems increases, integration is required across all levels of biological organisation – from molecules to the biosphere – and the diversity of species – from single-celled to multicellular organisms. Modern Zoology naturally provides this integration, and our programme offers modules and choices that focus upon important themes of environmental and medical/veterinary biology.With the key focus of zoology being the study of whole organisms, it is a course that touches on nearly all aspects of the biology programme including molecular, cellular, behavioural, parasitological, ecological and environmental aspects of animals. The central narrative to our programme is understanding the evolution and diversity of animals using a variety of approaches such as genetics, microscopy, experiments and field observations. The Zoology course is designed, not only to provide specific knowledge about key areas of animal biology, but also to encourage critical thinking and the development of numeracy and literacy, as well as the exploitation of sources of scientific data.This broad and transferable skill set provides a solid scientific framework from which to think creatively and explore the natural world and its interactions with human society. Throughout the course there is a strong emphasis on ‘hands-on’ aspects, with a high laboratory component, use of museum material and a choice of local and international field trips.Zoology is the study of the form and function of animals in the broadest senses of those words. It considers the many roles of animals within the natural world. The Department believes in the principle of ‘research-led teaching’ and has a diverse array of active researchers addressing a wide range of Zoological questions, broadly separated into organismal biology and molecular/cellular biology. Our investigation and teaching of these subjects uses innovative techniques and methodologies such as immunology, stable isotopes, genetics, analytical chemistry, proteomics and numerical computation. In particular, our strengths lie in ecosystem ecology and biodiversity, global change biology, parasite biology, ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, evolution of behaviour, comparative anatomy and physiology and developmental biology. You can learn more about our research and teaching at our School’s YouTube page (www.youtube.com/channel/UC).Many graduates of Zoology are currently pursuing academic and research careers in Ireland and overseas – our network of research alumni can be found on every continent. Professor William Campbell graduated from Zoology with a particular interest in parasite biology and went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 for his transformative work on discovering a class of drugs effective against the disease River Blindness caused by a parasite. Several of our graduates have gone onto postgraduate Veterinary and Medicine courses. Graduates have been employed within the agriculture and fisheries sector (Teagasc, BIM and Inland Fisheries Ireland), the environment and wildlife services (EPA, National Parks and Wildlife Service, National Biodiversity Data Centre and various Local Authorities), biomedical industry and agencies (HSE) and with international environment and development agencies (FAO, IUCN, WBCSD, etc.). Trinity Zoology graduates have taken up wildlife and environmental publishing, film-making and other careers in the media, software development, data science, second and third-level teaching, medicine, veterinary, museum and tourism work, environmental lobbying with national and international NGOs, environmental and wildlife consultancy, fish farming and – yes – we even have graduates who work in zoos.Students who wish to study Zoology apply to the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (TR060) and may select Zoology as their specialist area for the third and fourth years. In third and fourth year, the course highlights the major concerns of modern zoology in relation to environmental and medical biology, and introduces you to cell biological and other analytical techniques, fieldwork and computer-aided data handling and processing. Modules taken cover topics such as animal diversity, comparative physiology, ecology, marine biology (including a field trip) and terrestrial ecology (including a fieldtrip). In addition, there are a range of more specialised optional modules which may be selected in the areas of environmental or medical zoology such as genetics, behaviour, developmental biology, entomology and parasitology. A major component of the fourth year is an individual Capstone research project. In previous years such projects have looked at parasites in humans and animals, behaviour of badgers, deep sea fisheries and the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and the environment, to name but a few.Click Here for further information on modules/subject.Do you enjoy:",
