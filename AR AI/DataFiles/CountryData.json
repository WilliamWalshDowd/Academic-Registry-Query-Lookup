Dublin is a sophisticated city and has a lot of nature. I really enjoyed to live and socialise in Dublin. Studying at Trinity was also a precious experience for me. I studied with many talented students who were from all over the world. We enjoyed to study together and going out together. Trinity provides a wide range of module choices with high educational standards. I gained deep understanding of computer science and business which helped me to get a great job in Japan and is still helping me to work smoothly in a real business environment.
