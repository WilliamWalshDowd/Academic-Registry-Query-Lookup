# Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup
A simple AI implementation of 2 models that use data from the tcd.ie website to answer queries.

## Content
There are 4 different folders each with there own files that do:
1. Course Content searching in multiple different methods
2. Data File used by search functions
3. General query search functions with various implementations
4. Web Scrapper files for adding data to data files

### Running
To run each of the versions make sure to check that the data files are added or else you wont have any data to query. The scraper files propogate the data files but double check them if the program ins't working as intended.
Running each of the query files will simple work in the terminal. Examples of how they work is below.
> py \Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup\AR AI\AllQueries.py
This will run the best of both query asnwering functions together and will propt which one to use in the terminal.

### Scrappers
Each scrapper does a different type of page on the tcd.ie website. Not all pages and page content works since they are werirdly formated. try them and double check the data is formated correctly. it tends not to get incorrect data but rather missing or poorly formated ones.
#### - Course Scrapper
The course scrapper looks in the course search page of the website and collects the relevent data from each course page. There is also a course links file that is regenerated by each tim its run but not saved. To save, simple un-comment the "saveToJson" line. Below is the example output from running it.

#### - Content Scrapper (ScrappyMcScrape)
This scrapper is designed to scrape the general query pages on the tcd.ie website. It isn't perfect since each page is alittle different but it will get the magority of the content for each page while formating it and labeling it. the example of a page and its output is below.
> **Website:** "https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/fees-and-payments/"

> **Output:** ![image](https://github.com/WilliamWalshDowd/Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup/assets/99445178/aba8ac2a-34da-48ff-969f-bc62eb643be0)
