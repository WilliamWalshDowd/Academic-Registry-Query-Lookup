# Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup
A simple AI implementation of 2 models that use data from the tcd.ie website to answer queries.
This document will outline each part focusing on how they work and what their output looks like.
There is no functioning frontend as a host server is needed but will work when set up with one. There is a web page and related files for implementing all the user interface (see Website Running).


## File Content
There are 2 different folders each with their own files. Folder 1 holds Data File used by search functions. Folder 2 is for Web Scraper files that add data files.
There is then an AllQueries.py that has all the searching functions and model loading classes. It needs the data files to run but can be called from outside or run directly to get a command line testing interface.

### Running
  To run each of the versions make sure to check that the data files are added or else you wont have any data to query. The scraper files propogate the data files but double check them if the program ins't working as intended.
Running each of the query files will simple work in the terminal. Examples of how they work is below.
> py \Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup\AR AI\AllQueries.py
> 
This will run the best of both query asnwering functions together and will propt which one to use in the terminal.

## Examples
### Course Search example:
  This query handler works on the course data loaded from the course scrapper. it looks at all 500ish courses to decide which one is being asked about and what information is required from it. There is very little specifics in the course data about the course itself. ie, what modules are involved or credit requiremetns. Althought that information shouldnt be needed by the registry since its specific to the schools themselves.
> **input:** "what are the admission requirements for Economics?"
> 
> **output:**
```json
{"Admission Requirements: \nCandidates should normally hold at least an upper second-class honors degree that has a significant quantitative component, most commonly single or joint honors Economics degrees.\n ", "Link": "https://www.tcd.ie/courses/postgraduate/courses/economics-msc--pgraddip/"}
```
### General Query example:
  This is the main quey handler that answers any type of question as long as the data is loaded in. The more data is loaded the less accurate it gets but thats to be expected due to the similraity of the data. The answers tend not to be wrong just less precise that needed. It links to the webpage to get around this since if its not in the page then it wont be anywhere either way.

## Data Files:
  The data files are simple json files that can be filled using the webscrapper files. The academic registry data files are currently beng used by the query answerer but more data will be added to it. All 5 files are used but the testData.json is a testing file and isnt needed for production.

## Web Scrappers
  Each scrapper does a different type of page on the tcd.ie website. Not all pages and page content works since they are werirdly formated. try them and double check the data is formated correctly. it tends not to get incorrect data but rather missing or poorly formated ones.
### Course Scrapper
  The course scrapper looks in the course search page of the website and collects the relevent data from each course page. There is also a course links file that is regenerated by each tim its run but not saved. To save, simple un-comment the "saveToJson" line. Below is the example output from running it.
> **Course:** Drama Studies

```json
{
  "Overview": "Drama exists on and off the stage. Theatre happens in our everyday life. It is the basis for story-telling and other forms of performance within the creative arts. It has its origins in sacred ritual and remains central today as part of our sensemaking as we negotiate our place in the world. As with other creative arts, Drama and the insights from studying performance can be applied in the fields of medicine, politics, education and more.Theatre Studies encompass all the arts that make up the live experience we call theatre – including costume, lighting, sound, devising, directing, design, dramaturgy and playwriting. We also study the meaning behind theatre, analysing culture and politics, space and place, the presence of audience and performers, and the use of digital technology.Do you enjoy:All Drama pathways explore the relationship between the theory and practice of Drama and Theatre to discover how and why they work. The strong developmental emphasis of the courses requires a particular blend of practical and academic skills. In addition to a high level of analytical ability and creativity, you will need to possess resourcefulness and self-motivation.Teaching is by lecture, seminar and workshop, with a strong emphasis on experiential learning and practice-based research through theatre laboratory and production opportunities. This leads to a relatively high number of contact hours with other students for group projects, as well as the regularly timetabled taught classes. You will need to be a team player to succeed on this course.Single Honours students combine Drama Studies with Theatre Studies throughout their degree, whilst Joint Honours students combine it with another subject outside of the Department of Drama. Opportunities are available for Joint Honours students to engage more extensively in practice in their third and fourth years, if they select an exit pathway that includes Drama.Performing Arts at Trinity was ranked in the top 100 subjects worldwide in the QS Rankings 2021, reflecting the quality of our teaching and learning. Drama at Trinity is housed in the purpose-built Samuel Beckett Centre, home to the Samuel Beckett Theatre, the Players Theatre, a dance studio/rehearsal space, seminar rooms and offices. All our full-time staff have theatre-making experience and are published academic writers, active both nationally and internationally. Some modules are taught by visiting specialists, including award-winning designers, directors, performers and playwrights many of whom are alumni from the course.The pathways available are Single Honours, Major with Minor and Joint Honours. There is also the opportunity to take up Drama Studies as a New Minor Subject from second year.Many of our graduates seek employment in theatre or related professions and a large percentage of today’s Irish theatre-makers are alumni. Some graduates opt to take further training or apprenticeships, whilst others go straight into working in specialist areas of theatre, film, or television (such as directing, acting, design, playwriting, management, community drama and teaching). Some have formed their own theatre companies; many have won awards. Others have chosen research careers beginning with further study at postgraduate level. Even for graduates who decide not to pursue theatre as a career, the core skills of research, writing, organisation, collaboration, and interpersonal communication that they gain on the course last a lifetime.First and second years will provide you with a foundation in the skills and vocabularies of the theatre historian, analyst and practitioner. During these years, the course introduces drama, theatre and performance, and places them in a contemporary and relevant context. Teaching is by lecture, seminar and practical workshop, covering Theatre History (from the Greeks to the present), Performance Analysis, and Contemporary Performance Research (including studies in semiotics, feminism and gender, dramaturgy, postmodernism and more). Single Honours students also take courses in practical areas of theatre (Embodied Practices, Performance and Technology, and Crew Rotation). Training in study, research, and writing skills is provided to support you with the academic elements of the course.Student choose from a wide range of optional modules, striking a balance between the academic and the practical nature of the course (based on your chosen exit pathway).The range of modules allows you to favour study in historical and theoretical fields or in practical aspects of theatre. The range of options may include theatre and Ireland, embodied Shakespeare, stage, costume and lighting design, playwriting, devising, directing, theatre management, acting, performance and technology, women and theatre, and applied drama and theatre. Students exiting through Drama as a Major, Joint Honours, or Single Honours subject also complete a staff-supervised Capstone project. The Drama Capstone project allows students to integrate their interests into an individual research submission (such as a long dissertation or blended practice-as-research).Assessment is by a combination of essays, reflections, practical assignments, class presentations, oral examinations Students exiting through Drama via Major, Joint Honours or Single Honours subject are required to complete a Capstone project.There are QQI/FET routes available for this course. Please see www.cao.ie for details.Click here for further information on modules/subject.You may apply to spend third year studying abroad at a European university as part of the Erasmus exchange programme or at one of Trinity’s non-EU partner universities.",
