# Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup
A simple AI implementation of 2 models that use data from the tcd.ie website to answer queries.

## Content
There are 4 different folders each with there own files that do:
1. Course Content searching in multiple different methods
2. Data File used by search functions
3. General query search functions with various implementations
4. Web Scrapper files for adding data to data files

### Running
  To run each of the versions make sure to check that the data files are added or else you wont have any data to query. The scraper files propogate the data files but double check them if the program ins't working as intended.
Running each of the query files will simple work in the terminal. Examples of how they work is below.
> py \Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup\AR AI\AllQueries.py
> 
This will run the best of both query asnwering functions together and will propt which one to use in the terminal.

## Examples
### Course Search example:
  This query handler works on the course data loaded from the course scrapper. it looks at all 500ish courses to decide which one is being asked about and what information is required from it. There is very little specifics in the course data about the course itself. ie, what modules are involved or credit requiremetns. Althought that information shouldnt be needed by the registry since its specific to the schools themselves.
> **input:** "what are the admission requirements for Economics?"

### General Query example:
  This is the main quey handler that answers any type of question as long as the data is loaded in. The more data is loaded the less accurate it gets but thats to be expected due to the similraity of the data. The answers tend not to be wrong just less precise that needed. It links to the webpage to get around this since if its not in the page then it wont be anywhere either way.
> **input:** "what financial support is available to me as a SUSI student?"

### Country Query example:
  This query handler is similar to the course search but answers questions based on countries and there requirements instead of courses.
> **input** "What are the undergraduate requirements for Malta?"
>
> **output** ![image](https://github.com/WilliamWalshDowd/Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup/assets/99445178/34210ea0-d217-4b7c-af40-714d1711e9f5)

## Data Files:
  The data files are simple json files that can be filled using the webscrapper files. The academic registry data files are currently beng used by the query answerer but more data will be added to it.

## Web Scrappers
  Each scrapper does a different type of page on the tcd.ie website. Not all pages and page content works since they are werirdly formated. try them and double check the data is formated correctly. it tends not to get incorrect data but rather missing or poorly formated ones.
### Course Scrapper
  The course scrapper looks in the course search page of the website and collects the relevent data from each course page. There is also a course links file that is regenerated by each tim its run but not saved. To save, simple un-comment the "saveToJson" line. Below is the example output from running it.

### Content Scrapper (ScrappyMcScrape)
  This scrapper is designed to scrape the general query pages on the tcd.ie website. It isn't perfect since each page is alittle different but it will get the magority of the content for each page while formating it and labeling it. the example of a page and its output is below.
> **Website:** "https://www.tcd.ie/academicregistry/fees-and-payments/"
> **Output:** ![image](https://github.com/WilliamWalshDowd/Academic-Registry-Query-Lookup/assets/99445178/aba8ac2a-34da-48ff-969f-bc62eb643be0)
### Country Scrapper
  This scrapper is used to get all the country information and add it to the list. This is in a very similar format to the course scrapper but gets requirements for countries and there available resources to help apply.

## Website Running
  The website is not functional as it needs a backend which will be set up later. It can be run to see what it looks like but its not possible to answer questions. All the functions are set up just not plugged in. To run the website localy you can use this comand:
> python -m http.server 4000
  Then go to http://localhost:4000/ to see the webpage.
